Desc : README file of codes for LING773 final Project
       ( Peng Ye, Youngil Kim, Olivia Buzek )

These codes build ARFF files, input file of the Weka, 
we can predict joint profit through the result of Weka.
See our writeup for details of the features that we used.
These codes can be run on any platform as far as python & perl are installed.

Dependencies :
  We used Perl 5.10.1 for running the programs.
  We used Python 2.6.5 for running the programs.
  We installed Weka 3.6.4 for processing ARFF files.
  Make sure Ted Perdersen's Ngram Statics Package is installed, and the "bin"
  directory exists in PATH. So, you should be able to run "count.pl" without
  specifiying any paths. ( it is used in "create_ngram.py" )

  Before running the program you should check the directory structure.
  All the programs should be in "code" directory and "resources" directory
  should contain raw data. In addition, there should be "results" directory
  for storing the result of programs. This structure is already contained
  in this compressed file. So, just uncompressing the file will show the
  directory structure.

Basic directory structure :
    <root> - README : this file
           - codes/
                   baseline.py 
                   code_based_feature.py
                   create_ngram.py
                   feature_selection.py 
                   global_variable.py 
                   process_ngram.py 
                   run_prediction.py
                   stop-word.txt
           - resources/
                   fields_speaker.txt
           - results/

How to run the programs :

1. Build pre-processed resource file
   <Peng : how to create fields_speaker.txt> 

2. Build ngram csv & ngram id files 
   Just runt "./create_ngram.py" without any arguments.
   # ./create_ngram.py 

3. Build ARFF files


4. Using Weka
