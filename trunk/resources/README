LIWC2007
  This is Pennebaker's LIWC dictionary.  The top of the file defines a
  set of word categories, e.g. "posemo" for positive emotion words.
  The remainder of the file maps from words (actually word prefixes
  in many cases, which is his way of capturing morphological variation)
  to categories.  For example, 'account*' (which would match account,
  accounts, accounting, accounted, etc.) is in just one class,
  358 (money).
