merged_turns.csv
  This is the set of negotiation dialogues.  Each dialogue (identified as a 
  "dyad", i.e. which pair of speakers) consists of a set of
  numbered "thought units".  A single speaker turn may consist
  of several thought units.  With each thought unit, we identify
  the speaker (Wine or Grocery, depending on the role that person
  was playing in the negotiation) along with the coder's annotation
  for that thought unit.  (We might also refer to this
  annotation as a "code" or a "label".)

metadata.csv
  This file contains metadata for each dyad.  See Imai and Gelfand (2010)
  for explanations of these items.  Note that for numeric quantities, e.g.
  cultural intelligence (CQ), the value in the table is the average value
  for the two participants in the dyad.  We are investigating whether it
  is possible to get these values broken out by individual partipants.
  Also note that "joint profit" is the measure of success in the negotiation.

First_speaker.txt
  This file identifies, for each dyad, whether the first speaker in the dyad
  is the American (A) or East Asian (E) participant, in case it is useful to
  distinguish the origin of the participant when exploring features that might
  help predict successful negotiations.

Coding Manual 2006.doc
  This is the coding manual for the human coders.  It explains in considerable
  detail what the codes mean, and how speaker turns were broken up into
  discrete "thought units".

Payoff Schedule.doc
  In case it's of interest, this is the payoff schedule, identifying the 
  profit (in "points") for different outcomes of the negotiation on the
  five dimensions under discussion. (See Imai and Gelfand (2010) for details.)

FINAL GROCERY.doc
FINAL WINE SHOP.doc
  These were the instructions given to the participants.
