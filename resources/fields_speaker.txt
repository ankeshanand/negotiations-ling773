3	267	Grocery	East Asian	QP	When do you prefer to open then?,
3	268	Wine	America	OS	9:30? Would that be okay?,
3	269	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I guess that?s a little bit too late for me.,
3	270	Grocery	East Asian	PM	How about we skip this issue and move on to the rest and then go back to the first one?,
3	271	Wine	America	MIN	Okay.,
3	272	Wine	America	QP	What time would you be willing to close for the hours of operation just to get a sense of?if not 6:30 then?,
3	273	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Like 7:30 would be fine
3	273	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	?cause most of work is like 12 hours per day and 7:30 is still tolerable to me just on the breakfast.,

3	293	Grocery	East Asian	QM	So what do you think about that?,
3	294	Wine	America	MIC	"""Yeah,I think that we can do that"
3	294	Wine	America	CS	"and especially if we negotiate on the day that we open,"","
3	295	Wine	America	IP	because what I want for opening is to spend more money and getting it open quicker,

3	303	Grocery	East Asian	PP	"""Sure,so let?s discuss those two at the same time."","
3	304	Wine	America	PP	Because those two are related.,
3	305	Grocery	East Asian	QP	"""Right,when do you want to open it?"","
3	306	Wine	America	IP	I wanted to open May 1.,
3	307	Wine	America	OS	But maybe June 1?,

3	313	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""September 1,that?s the ideal case."","
3	314	Wine	America	MIN	Okay.,
3	315	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Because I want to give me enough time to train my employees. You know training people takes time.,
3	316	Wine	America	MIN	Oh okay.,
3	317	Wine	America	QP	Well if not September then?,
3	318	Grocery	East Asian	PP	"""How about like,let?s  keep it October, I mean, sorry, August, so I open it earlier and meanwhile I?ll still keep training my employees and you could spend more, I mean, I could spend more money on the renovation costs. So we could get some balance."","
3	319	Wine	America	OM	"""Okay,well then if we open in August, maybe, that way I can use my money with the time that we?re not, well with the time that we?re, by not opening in May but if you?re willing to spend $25,000 to start getting it, or renovate it, then I guess that would kind of even it out, even out the costs."","
3	320	Wine	America	SBR	So we?ll open a little bit early and you can recuperate some of those costs.,

3	322	Wine	America	MIC	"""Yeah,how does that sound, that way, I?m kind of losing money but you?re kind of losing money as well."","

3	326	Wine	America	MIN	"""I,let me see, I?m not sure?"","
3	327	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I prefer to keep like 60% of the floor space,

3	410	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""Exactly,I agree with that."","

3	415	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I was hoping they could still buy their breakfast at 8:30.,

3	417	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""Yeah,I agree with that."","

4	426	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Hi.
4	427	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	So according to my chart I have....
4	428	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Hopefully you can understand what I am talking about.
4	429	Wine	American	MIC	Yeah sure.
4	430	Grocery	East Asian	PO	"""I have five issues we have to talk about our operation,when we should close our space, and temperature and grand opening date."

4	433	Grocery	East Asian	IR	"""My main concern would be the hour of operation,the temperature, and the grand opening date?"
4	434	Grocery	East Asian	PO	they will make me the deal but other than that we can negotiate.
4	435	Wine	American	MIN	Of course.
4	436	Wine	American	QR	How important is floor space to you?
4	437	Wine	American	QR	Is floor space less important to you?,
4	438	Grocery	East Asian	IR	"""Floor space,well I would say so yeah."
4	439	Grocery	East Asian	QM	How about you?
4	440	Wine	American	PC	"""Yeah,floor space is negotiable."
4	441	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""Negotiable,uh huh."
4	442	Wine	American	OS	So for the temperature how would you feel about say 69 degrees?
4	443	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Well?because?let me think.
4	444	Wine	American	QP	You could do better?
4	445	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""Yeah I can do better for that yeah,but we can think about that."
4	446	Wine	American	MIN	Ok I?ll think about that one.
4	447	Grocery	East Asian	IR	Yeah I think yeah the more important issue for me is the grand opening date.
4	448	Grocery	East Asian	QR	How about you?
4	449	Grocery	East Asian	QR	What is the most important issue for you?
4	450	Wine	American	IR	Hours of operation is important to me to
4	451	Wine	American	PP	"""but you know,if you?ve got an opening date you were more comfortable with I could get hours that maybe I was more comfortable with depending?"
4	452	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Depending on um hum I could talk about the points right here in the packet.
4	453	Wine	American	QM	The what?
4	454	Grocery	East Asian	OT	The points here.
4	455	Wine	American	QM	"""Um,I?m sorry one more time?"
4	456	Grocery	East Asian	OT	"""Anyway,I mean I can talk about the number of points I can get right here."
4	457	Wine	American	OT	Um I don?t think so.
4	458	Wine	American	OT	I think we are suppose to keep that?
4	459	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Secret.
4	460	Wine	American	OT	"""Yeah,right."
4	461	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Anyway yeah.
4	462	Grocery	East Asian	QP	How about the grand opening date?
4	463	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""For me I think if the grand opening date is at Spetember 1st,that would be the best for me"
4	464	Wine	American	IP	Ok well I would do well with hours of operation from 10:30 AM to 10:30 .
4	465	Wine	American	QM	That wouldn?t be the best for you?
4	466	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""Yeah,I think so yeah."
4	467	Wine	American	QM	That would work well for you?
4	468	Grocery	East Asian	RN	"""This not work well for me,"
4	469	Grocery	East Asian	PP	but I think umm you know we can make a deal here.
4	470	Wine	American	OS	Ok so like September 1st opening date?
4	471	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""And our hours of operation,10:00 to 10:30 yeah."
4	472	Wine	American	RP	"""Ok,that works for me."
4	473	Wine	American	QR	So you said renovation costs were less important to you but temperature was more important?
4	474	Grocery	East Asian	IR	Yeah temperature is very important for me you know.
4	475	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	My grocery store has fresh fruit; I cannot have a temperature that you know
4	476	Grocery	East Asian	IP	yeah but the renovation costs I don?t want to spend much too yeah.
4	477	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	That?s for many reasons.
4	478	Wine	American	QP	"""Right,so you don?t want to spend much on renovation costs but you would want um a lower temperature for the fruit or a higher temperature for the fruit?"
4	479	Grocery	East Asian	IP	A higher temperature.
4	480	Wine	American	MIN	"""For the fruit,ok."
4	481	Grocery	East Asian	QP	What is the temperature you think you would like to have?
4	482	Wine	American	PC	Um I?m somewhat negotiable on the temperature.
4	483	Wine	American	IR	The renovation costs would be more important to me
4	484	Wine	American	PP	so I could be willing to go for a lower temperature if we spent a little bit more on renovation costs.
4	485	Grocery	East Asian	IR	Well for me temperature is more important.
4	486	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I think the temperature is high the best for me.
4	487	Grocery	East Asian	IR	The renovation costs is not my immediate issue.
4	488	Grocery	East Asian	IR	I mean you know it is an important issue for me too but?.
4	489	Wine	American	OM	"""Well what if we did a higher temperature like 73 degrees but we also did a higher renovation cost like 30,000 dollars."
4	490	Grocery	East Asian	RP	Oh that would be good for me.
4	491	Wine	American	QM	That would be a good trade off for you?
4	492	Wine	American	MIC	Well that works for me too.
4	493	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So the floor space you need?For the floor space I need more actually.

7	742	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah I know,but the breakfast is very early and it will be too much work"
7	743	Wine	American	INN	And I see that you are going to be serving some breakfast.
7	744	Wine	American	IP	Now I would prefer to open at 10:30.
7	745	Wine	American	INP	And I realize you are going to miss your breakfast hour there.
7	746	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Oh if we open at 10:30,everybody will have lunch."
7	747	Wine	American	SBR	I eat breakfast at 10:30.
7	748	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Oh but it is only you not almost average people.
7	749	Wine	American	SBR	"""Everybody I work with eats breakfast at 10:30,"
7	750	Wine	American	PC	but what I am saying is that I am willing to compromise some on those hours
7	750	Wine	American	OS	and we could open at say 9:30 instead.
7	751	Grocery	East Asian	RN	9:30?
7	752	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I don?t think I have no business if we open that late.
7	753	Wine	American	QS	So breakfast makes it what percentage of you profit?
7	754	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	It?s a main part
7	755	Wine	American	QP	"""Well,give me a percentage."
7	756	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Maybe 40 percent.
7	757	Wine	American	QM	40 percent of your profits?
7	758	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
7	759	Wine	American	QS	Then why are they putting it together at all?
7	760	Wine	American	MINEG	If I am selling alcohol and you are selling breakfast then this isn?t going to work out for Benducci either.
7	761	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	Ahh of course we can.
7	762	Grocery	East Asian	PP	"""We can make short with the hour but can you let me open up earlier,I can give you more space."
7	763	Wine	American	MIN	I am actually more interested in?
7	764	Wine	American	QP	Well ok if you were to open at 8:30 what time would we close?
7	765	Wine	American	SBR	Have you ever tried to buy a bottle of wine at 9 o?clock at night and find that you can?t because the store is closed?
7	766	Wine	American	SBR	"""It?s very frustrating actually,I?ve actually done that.  I?ve gone to a liquor store at 9 o?clock at night. It?s the evening and I want to buy a bottle of wine and I can?t because it?s closed."
7	767	Wine	American	PC	It drives a lot of business away so I think we need to find a common ground here between you still getting your breakfast and me still getting my evening customers.
7	768	Grocery	East Asian	CS	Ok so let?s open earlier and close later.
7	769	Wine	American	OT	If we are allowed to do that I think that is a great deal.
7	770	Wine	American	OT	I think the woman in the next room here would tell us that we can?t do that.
7	771	Wine	American	PM	"""But we can think about that and move on to other issues and we will come back to that one,cause actually the hours? yeah so we?ll come back to that one."
7	772	Wine	American	MIN	Now once again talking about the space itself. Have you seen the space?
7	773	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Space you mean?
7	774	Wine	American	MIN	The physical space that we?re gonna be moving into?
7	775	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah I occupy the 60 percent.
7	776	Wine	American	MIN	No I am not talking about that now. What I am talking about is the physical space that we will be moving into.
7	777	Wine	American	MIN	Have you actually seen it?
7	778	Wine	American	MIN	You say you know what it looks like.
7	779	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Oh you mean the?
7	780	Wine	American	MIN	The place where we are going to be occupying.
7	781	Wine	American	SBR	Because it is going to need a little bit of work I think. In order to make it presentable for customers.
7	782	Grocery	East Asian	P1	"""I?m sorry,wait, we should discuss floor space or?"
7	783	Wine	American	P1	"""No,renovation costs."
7	784	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Renovation costs.
7	785	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Ok.
7	786	Grocery	East Asian	QP	So you need a lot of money to negotiate to renovate?
7	787	Wine	American	IP	I think that we are going to need to spend some money or at least I am willing to spend some money on renovations.
7	788	Wine	American	SBR	So this would just be money out of my pockets.
7	789	Grocery	East Asian	QP	So how much would you like to spend on your??
7	790	Wine	American	IP	"""I would like to spend 30,000 dollars on the renovations."
7	791	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	So you want to spend?
7	792	Wine	American	MIN	Yeah just out of my pockets.
7	793	Grocery	East Asian	QM	So how much would you like me to spend?
7	794	Wine	American	MIN	Whatever you?d like.
7	795	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""OK so I am willing to spend 10,000."
7	796	Wine	American	QM	Of your money?
7	797	Wine	American	CS	"""That?s fine as long as there is 30,000 of mine."
7	798	Wine	American	SBR	But then initially there would be a bigger return for me on the percentage of profits if I am going to be spending more money on the renovations up front.
7	799	Grocery	East Asian	OS	"""So you want this space,40 percent?"
7	800	Wine	American	P1	I didn?t know we were on that. I was still talking about renovation money.
7	801	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Oh excuse me.
7	802	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	I make a mistake.
7	803	Grocery	East Asian	IDN	"""So you want to spend 30,000 money. I want to spend 10,000 money."
7	804	Grocery	East Asian	OT	"Wine,""Ok,well according to what they gave us here which is complete I think that is fine"
7	805	Grocery	East Asian	CS	"""because I will spend 30,000 and you will spend 10,000 so total we?ll have 40,000 dollars for renovations. So I think that works fine."
7	806	Grocery	East Asian	PM	Ok so let?s move the next so?
7	807	Wine	American	PM	So we still haven?t completed our hours of operation but we will go back to that because there?s a couple of other issues to put on the table so?
7	808	Grocery	East Asian	QP	How about the temperature?
7	809	Wine	American	QS	What kinds of products are you selling?
7	810	Wine	American	SBR	I know you said you are going to be selling coffee but that gets kept on a warm plate so that is already at a good temperature and cookies that doesn?t really matter those come out of the oven and cool quickly anyway.
7	811	Wine	American	QS	What other kind of products are you going to be selling?,
7	812	Grocery	East Asian	OS	How about 75 degree?
7	813	Wine	American	MIN	That wasn?t my question but that?s ok.
7	814	Wine	American	MIN	I was asking what kind of product you?ll be selling like what sort of items.
7	815	Grocery	East Asian	QP	What do you how hot do you want?
7	816	Wine	American	MIN	That?s not my question.
7	817	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Ok I want to set the degree for 75.
7	818	Wine	American	QS	Right but I want some more information from you about your product before we talk about the temperature.
7	819	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Umm you want?
7	820	Wine	American	MIN	So for example if you are selling produce like fruits and vegetables and things then lower temperature is going to be better for you because it is going to preserve your produce.
7	821	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Ok cause I make the coffee and the cookie"
7	821	Grocery	East Asian	IP	,I want the temperature higher.
7	822	Wine	American	SBR	But coffee is going to be on a warm plate. It is always on a warm plate so temperature is irrelevant for coffee because it has its own container and for cookies they cool when they come out of the oven anyway
7	823	Wine	American	SBR	and actually warmer is going to raise our heating costs in the winter so that is going to be more expensive
7	824	Wine	American	SBR	and in the summer less people come in the store because it is going to be no cooler than outside
7	825	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Do you think temperature is a problem for you?
7	826	Wine	American	SBR	Yes it is because alcohol doesn?t taste good that warm.
7	826	Wine	American	IP	Alcohol needs to be kept cooler.
7	827	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""You know if we turn on the air conditioner,it will cost a lot of electric."
7	828	Wine	American	SBR	"""It will; however,if you?ve got customers walking by on the street and it?s warm out in the summer they come in, it?s cool inside they stay longer they buy more."
7	829	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I don?t think so.
7	830	Wine	American	SBR	I do.
7	831	Wine	American	SBR	"""If it?s a warm store I?d leave if it?s already warm outside; if it?s a cool store I can stay for a while and get cold and get comfortable,I?d stay longer."
7	832	Grocery	East Asian	QS	How about winter?
7	833	Wine	American	SBR	"""Well in winter,it?s going to keep our heating costs down to not be so warm"
7	834	Wine	American	SBR	"""and in winter you are wearing a winter coat anyway so you go into the store if it is too warm in the store in the winter you start to sweat you take your jacket off,you have to find somewhere to put it."
7	835	Wine	American	SBR	"""So actually,also I am from Minnesota I just don?t like warm. This is my own personal preference as well, I prefer cool, in warm, I don?t function."
7	836	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Ok,so you know for me, for coffee if it is out of the container it will decrease temperature."
7	837	Wine	American	SBR	Well right but the coffee is going to be in the container until somebody buys the cup of coffee. That is how coffee is always sold.
7	838	Grocery	East Asian	QS	So if your wine is refrigerated it is ok?
7	839	Wine	American	SBR	"""Well wine generally is not kept in a refrigerator. Red wine should never be referigerated,it is served at room temperature. It just needs to be served at a lower room temperature"
7	840	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	OK I think?
7	841	Wine	American	SBR	I will have a refrigerator for some of the bottles of alcohol for example some white wines get chilled. SO there will be a refrigerator for white wines.
7	842	Wine	American	SBR	But most of the time wine is sold off of a rack in the store and if it is kept too warm then it doesn?t taste good anymore and it starts to degrade the wine.
7	843	Wine	American	SBR	"""Also if you are selling other things,which I am assuming you are selling more than coffee and cookies because coffee and cookies doesn?t fit with wine?.then?"
7	844	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""So ok,I want the temperature at 73 degree."
7	845	Wine	American	SBR	And my wine is still going to melt.
7	846	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Oh how many degrees do you want?
7	847	Wine	American	IP	I want it at 65.
7	848	Grocery	East Asian	RN	65?
7	849	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I will feel so cold everyday.,
7	850	Wine	American	SBR	Put on a jacket. You can always put on more clothes there is only so much you can take off to be legal.
7	851	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Do you think everyone will wear a jacket while he or she is working?
7	852	Wine	American	SBR	"""I am fine with 65 degrees,that is where I keep my house at."
7	853	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""If I was always working in a air conditioner room,I will catch a cold."
7	854	Wine	American	OS	"""Well I don?t want you to be cold all the time,how about 67?"
7	855	Grocery	East Asian	RN	67?
7	856	Grocery	East Asian	OS	How about 71?
7	856	Grocery	East Asian	IB	That is the bottom of my?
7	857	Wine	American	RP	Ok I?ll take 71.
7	858	Grocery	East Asian	P1	"""Ok,so at last uh?"
7	859	Wine	American	P1	Well we need to go back to the hours but first let?s take a look at the opening date then we?ll go back to the hours.
7	860	Wine	American	IP	"""So I would like to open as soon as possible,preferably May."
7	861	Wine	American	QP	What works for you?
7	862	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	You know I must train the employee for my shop and buy some stuff from the abroad.
7	863	Wine	American	SBR	"""But you have to train employees but I thought right now you are in a larger space and you are moving to a smaller space. In that case you are going to have to cut employees,not train more."
7	864	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I think we have no reason to open so soon.
7	865	Wine	American	SBR	The earlier we open the more profits we get from business.
7	866	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Umm but we can?t get prepared everything,get everything prepared for opening."
7	867	Wine	American	SBR	I?ll be ready by then.
7	868	Grocery	East Asian	QS	You have been ready?
7	869	Wine	American	SBR	"""Yeah,some of our product is sitting is storage. I will be ready by May."
7	870	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	You see the spacious room and nothing is here.
7	871	Wine	American	SBR	Yeah we?ve got a year. May 2006 a year is plenty to get the stuff ready.
7	872	Grocery	East Asian	OS	How about October?
7	873	Wine	American	TH	"""No October,I pull out and go find another business deal and you?ve got to find a new wine partner."
7	874	Grocery	East Asian	OS	"""Alright,how about September?"
7	875	Wine	American	MIN	Tell you what.
7	876	Wine	American	OM	"""I would be happy to open in September,if you give me the starting time of 9:30."
7	877	Grocery	East Asian	RN	9:30?
7	878	Grocery	East Asian	OM	How about 7:30?
7	879	Wine	American	RN	No.
7	880	Grocery	East Asian	IB	"""8:30,that is my bottom."
7	881	Wine	American	OM	8:30 and we open in May
7	882	Wine	American	OM	or 9:30 and we open in September.
7	883	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""If 8:30,I will open..you mean?"
7	884	Wine	American	PP	So I am willing to open at 8:30 and lose a couple of hours of business in the evening.
7	885	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	"""I can?t agree with the floor space,I occupy the 60 percent."
7	886	Wine	American	QM	I thought we already agreed to that.
7	887	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Ok we have agreed it?
7	888	Wine	American	MIN	I thought we did.
7	889	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""OK so I will Sepetember,9:30."
7	890	Wine	American	RP	Ok.
7	891	Grocery	East Asian	RN	No.,
7	891	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""How about September,8:30?"
7	893	Wine	American	RN	No.
7	894	Wine	American	OM	May and 8:30 or September and 9:30 or make me an offer I can deal with.
7	895	Grocery	East Asian	CS	"""I can put the hour at 8:30 and close the shop 9:30,is that ok?"
7	896	Wine	American	OT	I am fine with that I don?t think it?s in the rules that we can do that. According to the rules that they gave us the shop can only be open 12 hours. Otherwise I am fine with that. I believe we only get 5 categories to operate with and they are all 12 hour increments.
7	897	Wine	American	MIN	Yes.
7	898	Wine	American	MIN	"""Our options are 10:30 to 10:30,9:30 to 9:30, 8:30 to 8:30 and so on."
7	899	Wine	American	MIN	"""So like I said,9:30 is fine with me and then?"
7	900	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Ok.
7	901	Wine	American	QM	9:30?
7	902	Grocery	East Asian	OM	September and 9:30?
7	903	Wine	American	OM	August and 9:30.
7	904	Grocery	East Asian	RN	No!
7	905	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	"""You just told me,I think honesty is?."
7	906	Wine	American	MIN	"""I agree but in this case,I forgot some of my negotiating parameters."
7	907	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	So uh I think my stays is our?
7	908	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	So everybody must be honest with me.
7	909	Wine	American	MIN	And I was honest until I looked at my negotiating parameters. I hadn?t checked some of my facts properly when I made that offer and so?
7	910	Wine	American	MIN	well hold on.
7	911	Wine	American	OM	9:30 and September and we drop the temperature in the building 2 degrees.
7	912	Grocery	East Asian	QS	Why?
7	913	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	Now let?s be logical.
7	914	Wine	American	MINEG	I am being logical. I am a scientist but again so are you.
7	915	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	Yeah so uh you just ask me if I wanted open at?in September you will agree 9:30. Just a minute ago.
7	916	Wine	American	MINEG	"""You?re right I did and I pulled my offer. I took my offer back,this happens all the time in business, at least in this country. Until the offer is in writing, it is just negotiating back and forth. Car salesman do it all the time granted I shouldn?t use that as a good example but?"
7	917	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah I know so?
7	918	Wine	American	OM	So 9:30 in September is fine with me as long as we drop the room temperature to 69 degrees.
7	919	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	You didn?t have being honest.
7	920	Wine	American	MINEG	"""I am being honest right now,that?s my offer."
7	921	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	I can?t receive it.
7	922	Wine	American	MINEG	Ok well in that case we are at an impasse and I am not sure what we do in this case.
7	923	Wine	American	MINEG	We?re at an impasse and we?ve decided that we wouldn?t work very well together because she?s selling morning products and I?m selling evening products. So I think we would both like different business partners.
9	927	Grocery	American	MIC	Alright.,
9	928	Grocery	American	PO	""" It looks like we have five issues to discuss,and I dont know if you prefer doing them one at a time or doing them all together."","
9	929	Grocery	American	PO	""" But I think we should start one at a time and go over every one of them again so thatI meancause one of us is bound to be unhappy with it,with at least one outcome."","
9	930	Grocery	American	MIC	"""So I figure that way we can kind of minimize,you know, hard feelings and try to get to something that works for the both of us."","

9	933	Grocery	American	P1	Is there a specific one you want to start with?,
9	934	Wine	East Asian	P1	Can we start from the last one first?,
9	935	Wine	East Asian	MIN	I dont know which one,
9	936	Grocery	American	MIN	I dont know if the last one for you is the last one for me.,
9	937	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Oh I see,ok."","
9	938	Wine	East Asian	P1	Likecan we start from the grand opening date?,
9	939	Grocery	American	MIC	Sure.,
9	940	Wine	East Asian	QP	Which do you prefer?,
9	941	Grocery	American	IP	"""I would prefer September 1st,"","
9	942	Grocery	American	SBR	"""because I think that its very important for us to start the store by looking really good and being completely ready for everybody,"","
9	943	Grocery	American	SBR	"""and having good customer service,"","
9	944	Grocery	American	IP	so I think that would be the best date.,
9	945	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""For me,I think the early the better for us"","
9	946	Wine	East Asian	SBR	""" because like,everything is ready for us and we want to start early and make money."","
9	947	Wine	East Asian	IR	but maybe its not a big issue so we can talk about this,
9	947	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Can you just hurry up a little bit and so,
9	948	Grocery	American	IP	"""Sure,I think August 1st would be okay. Id be willing to do it then."","

9	950	Wine	East Asian	RP	"""Oh yeah,okay."","
9	951	Grocery	American	PO	So we can tentatively say that and we can adjust more.,
9	952	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Okay.,
9	953	Grocery	American	P1	"""Another issue that we have is the renovation cost and for that,I would sugguest that we just"
9	953	Grocery	American	SF	"I mean it looks like the renovation cost in total is $30,000"","

9	970	Wine	East Asian	OS	"""$20,000how about 25?"","
9	971	Wine	East Asian	IP	I prefer that.,
9	972	Wine	East Asian	SBR	25 because I also think good decoration is good for you.,
9	973	Wine	East Asian	QM	So think about that. You know?,
9	974	Grocery	American	SBR	"""I dont know,I think its more important to have good customer service than good decorations because I mean its a grocery store."","

9	1003	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""I think most people will buy it after 6:30,after they finish their work and they want to have wine or liquor in the home and just soits not a reasonable time for me."","
9	1004	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Well,I think that anything later than 7:30 would be gettingopening the store itself at 7:30, and for us, breakfast foods are out of the question, and that would be pretty much a dealbreaker for us"","
9	1005	Grocery	American	SBR	because we need to be able to sell those foods.,
9	1006	Grocery	American	SBR	I think the 7:30 option will still give you people two and a half hours after they finish work and if theyre having a dinner party or whatever they still have time to go buy the wine and go still have their dinner parties.,
9	1007	Grocery	American	IP	I think that would be a fair cutoff  but I think anything later than thats going to be really really tough for us.,

10	1082	Grocery	East Asian	P1	The first one is hours of operation.

10	1087	Grocery	East Asian	QM	8:30?
10	1088	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""When you go to work,8:30? You have to arrive at your company, so 8:30 for the people want to buy some breakfast, they are still late."

10	1094	Wine	American	P1	Lets go to renovation costs.
10	1095	Wine	American	IR	"""This is something that is very important to me,"

10	1101	Wine	American	SBR	"""Yeah but people dont buy groceries at a store that doesnt look good. If a store looks good then theyre going to be more likely to come in and buy things. If its kind of dingy,everybodys going to think the food is sketchy."

10	1103	Grocery	East Asian	QS	"""So why do you want to spend so many money on decoration,on what?"

10	1107	Wine	American	SBR	if it is the only store in the neighbohood then people will be willing to pay a little more for convenience I think.
10	1108	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yes.
10	1109	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	You might be right.
10	1110	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	But I still think..where should we spend the money on?
10	1111	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Actually,they decorate this shop already and it looks good, just okay, and theres still some..the things in the store"
10	1112	Grocery	East Asian	QM	"""what do you want,just add, to spend?"
10	1113	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Im still not clear.
10	1114	Wine	American	SBR	I guess I just dont really like the interior or the exterior.
10	1115	Wine	American	SBR	They both need some work.
10	1116	Wine	American	SBR	"""I just think in the end,its really going to boost, draw in more people and make more money. With a good look."
10	1117	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""Yeah,I agree."
10	1118	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""You know,my friend is good at exterior and interior work. Actually, hes my close friend. Hes good atlike that. I think he will give you a lower price. I think he can help us, so I think $30,000 is too much."

10	1120	Wine	American	IR	This is something I really care about a lot.
10	1121	Wine	American	SBR	"""The look of the store,Im very particular about this and I just think I have experience and I think that people want to tend to want to buy and come to places more when they look nice, Especially grocery stores."

10	1123	Grocery	East Asian	PM	Do you want to do the next one?
10	1124	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""I agree with you. Actually,I think we need decoration."
10	1125	Wine	American	OS	"""Okay,would you be willing to pay $25,000?"
10	1126	Grocery	East Asian	RP	"""Okay,because you really care about decoration."
10	1127	Wine	American	IR	"""Yes,thats something I really care about a lot. Its most important to me."
10	1128	Wine	American	QR	Whats most important to you?,
10	1129	Grocery	East Asian	IR	"""I think the most.I care about the grand opening date,"
10	1130	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""because I should have enough time to hire some employees and train them as I did before,because Im very experienced on management."
10	1131	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I know the staff working in the store is very important,not only in my store but also in your store, because customers, if they are willing to come, come here, one reason is our products. Another reason is our cashier, our staff in the store."
10	1132	Wine	American	QP	"""Okay,so what kind of date are you thinking about, July?"
10	1133	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""You know,now is June, so I think I have to hire some employees abroad, and give them training about how to do in our shop,"
10	1133	Grocery	East Asian	IP	so maybe, I think earliest date is September 1.
10	1134	Wine	American	MINEG	"""Oh wow,thats realy late you know?"
10	1135	Wine	American	IP	"""I guess right now its probably April,Im thinking."
10	1136	Wine	American	SBR	"""Since its so early in the year,if we need to hire people from another country and bring them over here to train them, lets see like a month to find people to hire, a month to get them settled, a month to train."
10	1137	Wine	American	OS	So how about July 1st?
10	1138	Grocery	East Asian	QM	July 1st?
10	1139	Wine	American	QM	Would that give you enough time?
10	1140	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah,actually, our problem is to find some suitable people abroad because our customers, most of our customers are from Mexico. Our people, we dont speak Spanish so I think its very very important to have such people who can speak English and Spanish so July 1st is obviously too early, yeah."
10	1141	Wine	American	MIC	"""That makes sense,I didnt realize that you didnt have people here who spoke Spanish."
10	1142	Wine	American	OS	How about August then?
10	1143	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""Yes,I know you give away your ground a little but August 1st actually is still early"
10	1144	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""because you know,some people have to decide how to hire them, train them, and settle them, and"
10	1145	Grocery	East Asian	IB	"""maybe,you know, actually, I dont have any other choice, just September 1st. I think just over four months is not enough for us."
10	1146	Wine	American	OM	"""How about this? Since Im going to be losing profit for that entire time when I could be open,how about we open September 1st, but when we open there we open there later, maybe like in 8:30 in the morning."
10	1147	Wine	American	SBR	"""That way,well still be open when people want to come in at night and buy things after work,"
10	1148	Wine	American	SBR	"""because Im going to be losing a lot of money during that time and I need to make up the hours or the time somehow if Im going to make it in the first week,the first few months."
10	1149	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""You know,the point is, if we dont suitable staff, we cannot open because they dont speak Spanish, and the customer, most of them cannot understand English."
10	1150	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""So,I think our point is, the time is enough for us to find the suitable staff in the store. Soit doesntwith out hour of operations."
10	1151	Grocery	East Asian	QM	So..can you think about grand opening date over again?
10	1152	Wine	American	SBR	"""After,I really think August is justunless I have some way to make up the money by having better hours, I just dont know, I just dont know if Im going to be able to stay afloat until September."
10	1153	Wine	American	OM	"""Ill be happy to wait until September if we could just open at least in the beginning have hours of operation that went a bit later like till,8:30."
10	1154	Wine	American	IP	"""I mean,ideally I would like something that would stay open late like 10:30"
10	1155	Wine	American	SBR	but something like 8:30 I could live with if you want to wait until September.
10	1156	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""Actually,on the second issue, I think Id beactually I want to spend as less money on the renovation cost,"
10	1157	Grocery	East Asian	PC	"""but I know you really care about this issue,since you care mostly so I give up."
10	1158	Grocery	East Asian	IR	"""I really care about the grand opening date,"
10	1159	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	because you know I really think the staff here is the most important.
10	1160	Wine	American	QM	Okay how about this? \,
10	1160	Wine	American	OM	If we can just spend $5000 more on the renovations to make the place look nicer,then Id be happy to open in September,
10	1162	Wine	American	SBR	"If we can just spend $5000 more on the renovations to make the place look nicer,""because were going to have more time to fix it up so we might as well,you know, use that time to make the place really nice."
10	1163	Wine	American	SBR	If we can just spend $5000 more on the renovations to make the place look nicer,This would be a way that would allow me to draw in more of my customers and make up some of the money Id be losing by delaying the grand opening.
10	1164	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Since its a hard issue heredo you think we surely have enough time to hire and train the staff if we open on September 1st? Do you think well have enough time?
10	1165	Wine	American	SBR	"""Oh yeah,youll definitely have enough time, September 1st,"
10	1166	Wine	American	OM	"""but like I said,Id be happy to open September 1st if you can spend a little bit more on renovations."
10	1167	Grocery	East Asian	QS	So you mean we have enough time to hire people if we open the door on August 1st? You think so?
10	1168	Wine	American	MIN	I think you would.
10	1169	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""Okay,if you think so, I think so, because we are coworkers, I mean, we are partners. We are friends."
10	1170	Grocery	East Asian	RP	"""Okay,so Ill agree with you. Well open on August 1st."
10	1171	Wine	American	MIN	Okay.
10	1172	Wine	American	OM	"""And then still the renovation is at 25,000 right before we decided,right?"
10	1173	Grocery	East Asian	RP	Okay.
10	1174	Wine	American	MIN	Okay.
10	1175	Wine	American	QP	"""How about the temperature,how do you feel about that?"
10	1176	Grocery	East Asian	QM	The temperature?
10	1177	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Whats your opinion?
10	1178	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""In our country,its very high the temperature. Nobody cares about that."
10	1179	Wine	American	QM	Nobody cares about that?
10	1180	Wine	American	SBR	"""For me,its best if its cold because I have wine that products that will go bad if its too warm."
10	1181	Wine	American	IP	"""So for me,65 degrees would be really good to keep everything from going bad."
10	1182	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah,maybe the good temperature to keep things but how about peoples feelings?"
10	1183	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""65 degree,people will feel so cold and not comfortable."
10	1184	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Actually,I have heard of article, research cite maybe 75 degrees goes well with peoples body."
10	1185	Wine	American	SBR	That may be true but a lot of my products are going to spoil at that temperature.
10	1186	Wine	American	IB	"""I mean,maybe I can go to like 69 degrees but that would be I think the very warmest before my things started to go bad."
10	1187	Grocery	East Asian	QS	What kind of things do you have to keep at a low temperature?
10	1188	Grocery	East Asian	QS	"""Your alcohol,wine or something?"
10	1189	Wine	American	SBR	My wine and some of my liquor.
10	1190	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""Oh,yeah. I know nothing about that."
10	1191	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	How about you buy a referidgerator?
10	1192	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I mean,some referidgerator to have youI mean, can keep themyou can just put them in the store right?"
10	1193	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I do think thats good.
10	1194	Wine	American	SBR	That would work but I need more money to renovate.
10	1195	Wine	American	PP	I probably need 5000 more to put in a referidgerator and referidgerator system.
10	1196	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""Actually,I think in this way you can raise your renovation cost, you can do that but the temperature I insist on 73 degrees,"

10	1198	Wine	American	OM	"""Okay,if we spend $30,000 on renovations, I would go for 73 degrees."

29	3962	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Mmmhmm.
29	3963	Wine	East Asian	MIN	So
29	3964	Grocery	America	IP	So theI would still say that 7:30 would be a lot better for me.

29	3979	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I can pay more if you want,I can pay 30."
29	3980	Grocery	America	MIN	I think this is our combined total so I think were going  be splitting this.
29	3981	Grocery	America	MIN	I guess it doesnt make any difference because either were both going to be paying 12/5 or we both will be paying 25.
29	3982	Grocery	America	RP	"""Okay,lets go to 25, that sounds fine to me."
29	3983	Wine	East Asian	QP	Do you want to make it to pay more?
29	3984	Grocery	America	MIN	"""I think,no, we both have to agree on the same number I think."
29	3985	Grocery	America	MIN	So your priority is more renovation and my priority is
29	3986	Grocery	America	OS	"""okay,yeah. 25, sounds good to me, oryeah25, lets do 25."
29	3987	Wine	East Asian	RP	Alright.

29	4039	Grocery	America	OT	"""So,in that case, youre going to need to convince me to start any earlier than August 1st."

30	4063	Grocery	American	SF	"""I am the grocery store,a specialty foods store."

30	4065	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""Yeah,right."
30	4066	Grocery	American	MU	People will be really able to use both of them and we might be able to really increase customers by having both of them.

30	4086	Wine	East Asian	QP	"""but,well, whats your proposal for them?"
30	4087	Wine	East Asian	QP	Whats your proposal for the hours?
30	4088	Grocery	American	IP	I think the best thing for us would be from 6:30am to 6:30pm.
30	4089	Wine	East Asian	RN	Ohhh.
30	4090	Wine	East Asian	IP	That will be too early for me.
30	4091	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Like one,people like to stay up late, people like to buy wines or, go to the store late, and stay up late so, that will be too early."
30	4092	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""So,one thing in my mind is that because were located in Dupont Circle, thats a good place for nightlife, so I think probably in the night there are, we will also get a lot of people."
30	4093	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Yeah,but the thing is people dont really do their shopping late so we really dont want to be open late."
30	4094	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah,so maybe you can sell more, things more, better for nights?"
30	4095	Grocery	American	SBR	"""I dont think so,given our, given our, like what we sell, breakfast is really where the majority of our profits are going to be."
30	4096	Grocery	American	QS	"""So I mean,it sounds like your store doesnt sell liquor right?"
30	4097	Grocery	American	SBR	It just sells wines so its really something
30	4098	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""No,no, it has liquor so"
30	4099	Grocery	American	QS	It has liquor too?
30	4100	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Wine and liquors and liquor probably would take a large part of the..sothe product so..
30	4101	Grocery	American	QS	"""I dont know,I mean, do you, have you spent much time in Dupont Circle?"
30	4102	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah,no, me, not personally but I know its a good place for night life."

30	4107	Grocery	American	SBR	"""It really is after,you know, 8 oclock at night, theres noone there."

30	4109	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""and I think another reason is that mmm,right now summer so people tend to stay up very late and you know, at night, you know, the sky begins to dark very late"

30	4112	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Oh no,I think also, like business people like to have"
30	4113	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Oh,I dont think so, people there are at work by 7am, so you know, like then they, they have to staff their parties and everything during the day so"

30	4125	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I know theres alreay like Starbuck and places over there
30	4126	Grocery	American	SBR	Yeah but this is more oriented towards the business people
30	4127	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""No,I think they already have the habits to go there, you know? So maybe it, they wont want to choose to go here for the breakfast very much but you know, like, we two together we will create some new spots for them, so like, they maybe like the wine, accompanied like the food sothere needs to be some, something special if we still go to for all the way like Starbucks dowe want to attract the people from the places."
30	4128	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Yeah,but I mean thats just notits just a different crowd, like. Starbucks is really the college students on their way and this is much more, you know, towards the people who live there who are pretty rich and you knowso and were not going to be, as far as I can tell, you know, were not going to be located right next to Starbucks or anything sothats just, I mean, thats the bulk of our business, its a lot of them."

30	4142	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""No but,you knowso it isI think it is located where it is the the its highly visible to both traffic and cars, so we really need to do something good to attract people"

30	4149	Grocery	American	QP	Well how much do you think we should spend on that?
30	4150	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I think 25,000 would be okay."
30	4151	Grocery	American	OS	"""I could maybe I could settle for like 20,25 is really beyond what we could do."

33	4541	Grocery	America	MIC	Yeah.
33	4542	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Okay.
33	4543	Grocery	America	MIC	Okay.
33	4544	Grocery	America	MIC	"""Yeah,so were moving into the same space and yeah"
33	4544	Grocery	America	P1	hours of operation seems to be a good place to start.
33	4545	Grocery	America	QP	"""So,I know as a winewhatwhat have been the hours of operation in your store so far, like, what youhow late did you usually stay open before?"
33	4546	Wine	East Asian	IP	We usually open from 11 in the morning and open until 11 in the night.
33	4547	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""You know,people buy liquor and wines in night."
33	4547	Wine	East Asian	IP	So we open open late and close late.
33	4548	Grocery	America	PC	"""Well,I was thinking maybe we can come to a compromise on this since being a grocery and having coffee and things like that,"
33	4549	Grocery	America	IP	wed like to open as early as possible to get that.
33	4550	Grocery	America	SBR	"""And the other thing I was thinking about is as well is in Washington D.C. where this will be located,they stop serving, they stop being able to stop alcohol at 10pm, so anything past 10 I dont think would be you know, prudent toyou wouldnt have any customers."
33	4551	Grocery	America	SBR	"""But like,we usually open at 6:30 in the morning and stay open until 6:30 at night but I think people are shopping later and later so"
33	4552	Grocery	America	OS	I was thinking maybe 7:30?
33	4553	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Okay,so you want have the hours of operation from 7:30 to 7:30?"
33	4554	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Well,hmm."
33	4555	Wine	East Asian	RN	"""Thats difficult for me,you know,"
33	4555	Wine	East Asian	SBR	cause after 7if we close at 7:30, we lose a lot of customers.
33	4556	Wine	East Asian	MIN	So Im thinking about
33	4557	Grocery	America	SBR	"""I was just thinking,I think like when do people.I was thinking from my own experience when I would buy wine and liquor and things because it seems like youre a more of a specialty wine shop rather than like a you know, people that are out partying want to go buy more booze or something so maybe if somebody could get you know, wine on the way home from work or something. So I was thinkinglike getting off of work at like 3 or 4 so it gives them you know, three and a half hours toto get wine."
33	4558	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah,and I, I, I agree that you said after 10 I get no customers"
33	4559	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""but I still think I would like to have 9:30 to 9:30,"
33	4560	Wine	East Asian	MU	"""cause Im thinking that since were sharing the space,were sharing the same group of customers."
33	4560	Wine	East Asian	SBR	The customers who drink wine and liquor in the night might not get up early in the morning, so they might like grocery hours to also be also later open and late close.
33	4561	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Thats aI was thinkingI was thinking that thethose customers are going to wine toits kind ofwere speaking to that. To use the title of my grocery store,were speaking to the Upper Crust, you know, the sort of people, the higher class customers so"
33	4562	Grocery	America	IP	"""I just like,I really dont want to go any later than 7:30"
33	4563	Grocery	America	SBR	because that way they can still get food and coffee on their way to work especially since.where our location is going to be.
33	4564	Grocery	America	SBR	"""I think a lot of stores in that area have similar hours,7:30 to 7:30 and a lot of stores close after that time because theres a lot of bars in the area and usually after 7:30, then people are going to the bars instead."
33	4565	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah,but location is also the thing I am thinking about, especially because we are located at Dupont Circle."
33	4566	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I once worked there for a couple of months and I feel its extremely helpful if I can buy something after 7 or 8 in that area.
33	4567	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""So I still thinking,love to have the 9:30 to 9:30."
33	4568	Grocery	America	IDN	"""Well,if were both stuck on like, you want 9:30 to 9:30 and I want 7:30 to 7:30,"
33	4568	Grocery	America	OS	can we go 8:30 to 8:30?
33	4569	Grocery	America	SBR	Cause then were going to lose an equal amount of customers.
33	4570	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""Right,right."
33	4571	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""Thats fair,thats fair now."
33	4572	Wine	East Asian	RP	"""Yeah,thats great, 8:30 to 8:30."
33	4573	Wine	East Asian	PO	So we can move to the next point.
33	4574	Grocery	America	P1	Renovation.
33	4575	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Renovation costs.
33	4576	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Well,Im thinking, Im probably going to have to do most renovation to the space cause its not set up for grocery right now, so referidgeration units and things like that, as far as dcor, I guess, were going to have similar dcor, so its not like were going to have buy separate decorating materials."
33	4577	Grocery	America	IP	"""Even with all that considered,like, I still can only think of having spend like $10,000"
33	4578	Grocery	America	SBR	"""because I would rather spend the money on getting quality like,gourmet food and training my employees and stuff."
33	4579	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Mmmhmm,thats reasonable."
33	4580	Wine	East Asian	MIC	I totally understand your situation
33	4581	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""but II need to tell you what I am thinking on this issue,because we are located in the neighborhood of Dupont Circle, our customers will be high class, the rich people. So I guess the...customers about the good looking of the grocery store and since were sharing customer group. I mean, I believe we will share a lot of customers in the future. So I do believe that a good looking environment is critical to my store,"
33	4582	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""so I would like to go 30,000 for the renovation costs."
33	4583	Grocery	America	QS	"""Um,how much equipment are you able to bring from your old location?"
33	4584	Grocery	America	QS	Do you have wine racks and stuff?
33	4585	Grocery	America	QS	"""Whats the 30,000 going to go to?"
33	4586	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I would like to spend most of this money on the exterior looking.
33	4587	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I would like to have a good looking to attract the people walking around so theyll choose our store instead of other places at their first glance of our store.
33	4588	Wine	East Asian	MU	"""So thats my thinking but we can discuss about this since this is our shared space,so I wanna"
33	4589	Grocery	America	PC	"""Well again,somewhere between the average would be 20,000 then, just half as much."
33	4590	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Its twice as much as what I want to spend so actually,twice asif you..if you want to spend more than half, thats 15,000, so I wouldI mean, theres no structural problem."
33	4591	Grocery	America	SBR	"""We dont have to.everythings just decorative and obviously,for the grand opening we need to have everything done in advance."
33	4592	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""And for this,I am thinking about the longterm benefits of decorating the store."
33	4593	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""If we buy better quality decorations,we can stand for longer times, thats better for us to save money in the future with thinking about using more money now to save for the future."
33	4594	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Also,if you want to spend $30,000, things might take a bit more time, so are you planningnot that we have to negotiate the grand opening right now but in you know, in accordance with renovation costs, it seems like you are going to need more time if you really want to spend that much money."
33	4595	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""Thats true,thats true, and I agree."
33	4596	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""I need time to wait for the grand opening,okay."
33	4597	Wine	East Asian	OS	"""So how about we go for the 20,000 is that okay for you?"
33	4598	Grocery	America	IP	"""It just seems like,I mean, I only wanted to spend 10,000"
33	4599	Grocery	America	SBR	and I think I have more.Im going to have more startup costs than you as far as products and things because I think youll be able to bring a lot of that from before and
33	4600	Grocery	America	QS	"""so now,I mean, what are you thinking about decoration? So mostly on like the front of the building."
33	4601	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Yeah,cause theres so many liquor and grocery stores nearby we have to have something outstanding and by their first glance they dont know the quality of the goods inside. Theyre pretty much attracted by the outside looking, thinking about that."
33	4602	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Yeah,Im just, see its, its twice as much as what I want to spend and thats only $10,000 less than what you want to spend."
33	4603	Grocery	America	PP	"""I mean,is there anyway you can do 15,000and maybe we could open a little earlier or something?"
33	4604	Wine	East Asian	RP	"""Well for now,yeah, I guess I could go a little earlier on the renovation costs."
33	4605	Wine	East Asian	PX	"""So I can compensate this by bringing more from my old store cause I think for the next two items,I need more of your support."
33	4606	Wine	East Asian	RP	"""So yeah,I agree to 15,000 for the final."
33	4607	Grocery	America	MIN	Okay.
33	4608	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Okay.
33	4609	Grocery	America	QP	So how much space do you want?
33	4610	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""Floor space,I would like to have 40%."
33	4611	Wine	East Asian	QP	How do you think?
33	4612	Grocery	America	QM	40%?
33	4613	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
33	4614	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Well yeah,I was trying to think of like, you know, we never shared the space so I was trying to think like, if you haveyoure going to have less room because of course, you can stock wine and things like that, and of course we talked about  our referidgeration units."
33	4615	Grocery	America	SBR	40%...I dont know what that means for rent.,
33	4616	Grocery	America	MINEG	Im a little unsure about that quite yet.
33	4617	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Im not sure either,until I do the research on the rent."
33	4618	Grocery	America	MIN	"""Yeah,exactly."
33	4619	Grocery	America	PX	"""Um,yeah, again, like, you know, Iyou compromised on the last one and I can, Ill need your support on some of these other ones"
33	4620	Grocery	America	RP	"""so I think 40/60 is fine. I got 60,you got 40."
33	4621	Grocery	America	MIC	Good.
33	4622	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Thank you.
33	4623	Grocery	America	P1	"""Alright,so temperature settings."
33	4624	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Well,you know, this is the key thing for us, for the liquor and wine cause thats the thing thats most important for us to keep the quality of the wine, liquor"
33	4625	Wine	East Asian	IP	so I will like to have the 65 degree as our room temperature.
33	4626	Grocery	America	QS	"""Is that for like,outside room temperature?"
33	4627	Grocery	America	QS	Are you going to have referidgeration units or?
33	4628	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Well we have referidgeration units but not all our liquor and wine will in the referidgerator. We still have a lot of stuff outside the referdigerator unit so the temperature is the key for us.
33	4629	Grocery	America	QB	Whats the highest temperature you can go without spoiling your products?
33	4630	Wine	East Asian	IB	"""Well I guess 65 degrees is the line,I cannot go beyond that."
33	4631	Grocery	America	QS	You cant?
33	4632	Wine	East Asian	IR	"""No,this is the one I really need your support because thats the key for us."
33	4633	Grocery	America	SBR	"""I mean,my main concern is that keeping, especially with D.C. summers, keeping it in a big place like this, condition at 65 degrees is going to be really really really expensive."
33	4634	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""Yeah,I know that, I understand that"
33	4635	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""but I think for you for the goods in the grocery store,you also need lower temperature to keep them fresh."
33	4636	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Well,my goods, I, most of my goods can stay, theyre fine up to like 75 degrees,"
33	4637	Grocery	America	SBR	"""I always tryI always try to keep things as high as I can you know to save us much money on heating and air conditioning things,"","
33	4638	Grocery	America	MINEG	so 65 just seems like
33	4639	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Its really expenditure on the.yeah,I know that but think about"
33	4640	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Like Ill have referidgeration units for my stuff that needs to stay colder,so thats something you could do as well, is have compartments where, you know, you can have things that need to stay colder, colder."
33	4641	Wine	East Asian	SBR	But we still have lots of things that cannot go into the referidgerator units. We have to keep the room temperature.
33	4642	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I consulted with the expertise in wine liquor and they said this is critical.
33	4643	Grocery	America	SBR	"""I know but you can have a unit that stays at 65 degrees just like a unit that keeps my stuff that needs to be below room temperature,below room temperature."
33	4644	Wine	East Asian	SBR	But that would cost me another big amount of money and I am thinking that,
33	4645	Grocery	America	CS	"""We could share the space. If we both have to do it,we could share the space that keeps things at a particular temperature."
33	4646	Grocery	America	MIC	"""Because my vegetables,Ill need to keep them around 65 degrees."
33	4647	Grocery	America	CS	"""But those other things that absolutely dont need to be in the cold,and its just the waymy way to keep everything that cold if we can have one unit and if were really you know,"
33	4648	Grocery	America	CS	if we want to split the bill in half then may be we can have that shared space that run down the middle and have one side each.
33	4649	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""Okay,that sounds like a good idea but its still not as good to me as the 65 degrees."
33	4650	Wine	East Asian	MIN	How about this?
33	4651	Wine	East Asian	PP	"""Since we have one item left,the grand opening date, I guess we have disagreement on that, so maybe we can you know, arrange these two items."

33	4653	Wine	East Asian	PP	"""Yeah,can I go for the 65 degrees as temperature and you do whatever grand opening date you want?"
33	4654	Grocery	America	MIN	"""Um,if I get whatever grand opening date that I want,"
33	4655	Grocery	America	SBE	"""because itllitll take awhile to get things ready,Im really concerned about that, because I need to go abroad and you know, talk to some, talk to some specialty products people,"
33	4656	Grocery	America	SBR	"""I really even 67 degrees will probably save us at least 10,000 a year."
33	4657	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Yeah but think about the renovation cost.,
33	4658	Wine	East Asian	SBR	You savedhow much?
33	4658	Grocery	America	SBR	"""I only save 5000 because were going to compromise the 20,000,and Ive only saved you knowjust 5000."

33	4660	Grocery	America	SBR	Well Im going from 75 degrees to 67 degrees.

33	4662	Grocery	America	IR	"""No,we dont but the renovation cost is something thatits just, its not as important."
33	4663	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Like,the renovation cost, its an upfront cost but temperature, if we agree on this and we continue business for the next 20 years, its something thats going to impact you know, its more important than like an upfront renovation cost."
33	4664	Grocery	America	OM	"""So what if we did,how about, we go up to 20,000 for renovation, we could go 67 for the temperature, and I can pick the grand opening date?"

46	6293	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Ok.
46	6294	Grocery	America	IR	And...especially the opening date because the renovation costs are for you to get the store prepared for what you think is important but the grand opening side is where I think its impo where I think the part of my business is important to get ready for.
46	6295	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok.
46	6295	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Ok sure we can agree on that.
46	6295	Wine	East Asian	OS	So 25 thousand is good for you?

46	6304	Wine	East Asian	MIN	floor space.
46	6305	Wine	East Asian	QP	What do you think?
46	6306	Grocery	America	IP	I really think that I should have more space.
46	6307	Grocery	America	SBR	Cause I havewine I feel can be kinda it should be tilted and it can be stacked really easily. Doesnt take up that much space.
46	6308	Grocery	America	SBR	But groceries need to be put outlike everything they need to be so the customer can see it.
46	6309	Grocery	America	IP	So I was thinking of at least 60% or 70% of space
46	6310	Wine	East Asian	OS	ok so you needHow about 60% for you?
46	6311	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Will it be good?

46	6319	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I think the... you have the grand opening date at Aug 1.,
46	6320	Wine	East Asian	IP	So we should have the temperature would be cooler temperature in summer time??  the temp will be cold?
46	6321	Grocery	America	IP	"""well I prefer,I prefer in the 70s"
46	6322	Grocery	America	SBR	just because thats what Im comfortable at.
46	6323	Grocery	America	QS	But dont know if your wine needs a specific temperature for
46	6324	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""well,you know, mostly because peopleif people at home, they store their wine in the basement for the cooler temperature so that we can assu...assure the good quality."
46	6325	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""So Im thinking well need to have a lower temperature,I mean, would be good for you and your customers."
46	6326	Grocery	America	MIN	yea I think especially cause we have an august 1st opening date or
46	6327	Wine	East Asian	MIN	like half of
46	6328	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Yea an also I mean,Im co.. Im a little concerned, about the price of the air conditioning with like oil princes being what they are."
46	6329	Grocery	America	SBR	"""You know,but since its in august, its just going to be a month or to of heat and then we canIt wont cost as much to keep the temperature as low when were going like for the rest of the season."

46	6331	Wine	East Asian	RN	69 degrees?
46	6332	Wine	East Asian	OS	How about 67?
46	6333	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Its just 2 degrees lower.

46	6349	Wine	East Asian	RP	Ok 69 will be fine then
46	6350	Grocery	America	MIC	Ok!
46	6351	Wine	East Asian	MIN	so we conclude that the hours of operation are 8:30 up to 8:30pm. Renovation costs would be 25 thousand. Floor space 40% for me and 60% for you. Temperature at 69 degrees and the grand opening date will be Aug 1.

47	6367	Grocery	NA	QP	"""Yes,about temperature?"
47	6368	Wine	NA	QM	Temperature?,
47	6369	Wine	NA	MIN	Ok.
47	6370	Grocery	NA	QP	What do you think about temperature?
47	6371	Wine	NA	IP	well for my products its best to have the building is as cool as possible.
47	6372	Wine	NA	SBR	It keeps the wine in its best state so.
47	6373	Wine	NA	SBR	But well we dont want the people to be so cold theyre uncomfortable in the store
47	6374	Wine	NA	OS	so how does 67 sound to you?
47	6375	Grocery	NA	RN	67?
47	6376	Grocery	NA	IP	For me the higher the better.
47	6377	Grocery	NA	SBR	But I dont know what productwhat kind of product I take.
47	6378	Grocery	NA	MIN	Just let me seeit should say.
47	6379	Grocery	NA	SF	"""I take care of bread,milk and fruits. Some kind of that and"
47	6380	Wine	NA	SBR	so do you think people might buy more if theyre colder or?
47	6381	Grocery	NA	MINEG	no
47	6382	Wine	NA	QM	no?
47	6383	Grocery	NA	PC	so maybe the middle one?
47	6384	Grocery	NA	OS	69 is better?
47	6385	Wine	NA	RP	Ok.
47	6386	Wine	NA	PO	"""Alright,so letslets start with that for now."
47	6387	Wine	NA	QP	How about the hours of operation?
47	6388	Grocery	NA	MIN	oh ok.
47	6389	Grocery	NA	SBR	"""For me,we have to sell the breakfast because early."
47	6390	Grocery	NA	IP	Just like 6:30 so...
47	6391	Wine	NA	MIN	Ok.
47	6392	Wine	NA	SBR	"""for me,most people...you know I sell wine and liquor and people usually have those in the evening so if we close at 6:30pm I wont get much business at all."
47	6393	Wine	NA	IP	So I really need to haveI really need to stay open as late as possible. So 10:30 would be best for me.
47	6394	Grocery	NA	MIN	uh huh.
47	6395	Grocery	NA	MIN	So
47	6396	Grocery	NA	SBR	but I think most companies start at 8 or 9 because of
47	6397	Grocery	NA	IP	so to sell the breakfast I have to chose 7:30
47	6397	Grocery	NA	IP	or 8:30.
47	6398	Wine	NA	MIN	ok
47	6399	Grocery	NA	MIN	at least.
47	6400	Wine	NA	SBR	ok so you dont think that maybe people who have offices nearby might you know go to work and then someone out for coffee and breakfast
47	6401	Wine	NA	SBR	so maybe you know then 9:30 would be ok?
47	6402	Wine	NA	SBR	Cause if people are getting to work at 9 oclock and they go to get breakfast to get started
47	6403	Grocery	NA	RN	Started at 9?
47	6404	Grocery	NA	IP	I think 8:30s better for us.
47	6405	Wine	NA	QM	8:30 is better?
47	6406	Wine	NA	MIN	Ok.
47	6407	Wine	NA	OM	How about if I agree to 8:30 and instead of 69 degrees we keep maybe at 67 degrees.
47	6408	Wine	NA	QM	You think thats ok?
47	6408	Wine	NA	OM	So we do 8:30 and 67?
47	6409	Grocery	NA	RP	ok
47	6410	Wine	NA	MIN	ok.
47	6411	Grocery	NA	IR	And my first priority is grand opening date.

47	6413	Grocery	NA	QM	What did it say?...
47	6414	Grocery	NA	SBE	oh yeaI need to order some special items from abroad.
47	6415	Grocery	NA	SBR	"""Like for example,for me, Im Asian so Asian food and some kind ofso I need to to differentiate from some other groceries. That is my diffrentiative point."
47	6416	Grocery	NA	SBE	But I need to order now so the items coming by September like...so...
47	6417	Wine	NA	QM	oh okso would it be possible to open the store withwithout some of the items from abroad?
47	6418	Wine	NA	SBR	I meancause if you have bread and milk and stuff also cold we open and just carry the bread and milk and then add the Asian items once they arrive?
47	6419	Grocery	NA	MINEG	I want to be readymade ready made.
47	6420	Grocery	NA	SBR	SoReadymade and advertise as were a differentiative store for some items.
47	6421	Grocery	NA	MIN	So
47	6422	Wine	NA	MIN	ok.
47	6423	Wine	NA	IP	I really need to start making money a little sooner than that.
47	6424	Wine	NA	OS	So what about maybe August?
47	6425	Grocery	NA	QM	August?
47	6426	Wine	NA	MIN	August.
47	6427	Grocery	NA	RP	ok.
47	6428	Grocery	NA	MIC	That makes sense.
47	6429	Wine	NA	QM	August is ok?
47	6430	Grocery	NA	MIC	Ok good.
47	6431	Grocery	NA	PO	Sothen renovation costs and floor space?
47	6432	Grocery	NA	QR	Whats your priority of the two?
47	6433	Wine	NA	SBR	"""well I think that since were in an area like Dupont Circle,we really need to make sure thatwe look very nice."
47	6434	Wine	NA	SBR	Ok because theyre a lot of nice businesses in the area and as you said we want to be different so that people make sure to come to us.
47	6435	Wine	NA	SBR	So weif we leave the place the way its looking now I dont think that its going to stand out and people are going to come.
47	6436	Wine	NA	IB	So I really think we should try and spend at least 25 thousand dollars on renovation. At least.
47	6437	Wine	NA	IP	30 would bewould be perfect.
47	6438	Wine	NA	IP	But I could live with 25.
47	6439	Grocery	NA	SBR	I know your situation but for me the grocery store is some kind of necessity so I dont really mind for the appearance of the .so
47	6440	Wine	NA	QP	ok so what did you have in mindspending to renovate..
47	6441	Grocery	NA	IP	of course for me the lower the better.
47	6442	Grocery	NA	QB	But its not for yousoso your sure at least 25 thousand?
47	6443	Grocery	NA	RP	Ok 25..
47	6444	Wine	NA	QM	25 is ok?
47	6445	Grocery	NA	MIN	ok.
47	6446	Wine	NA	MIC	Ok great.
47	6447	Wine	NA	MIC	Thank you.
47	6448	Wine	NA	P1	Ok and so that just leaves the floor space.
47	6449	Grocery	NA	SBR	In general the grocery store is bigger than wine shop oror some cooler shop so
47	6450	Grocery	NA	IP	my betterbest choice is 60%.
47	6451	Wine	NA	QM	60%?
47	6452	Grocery	NA	MIN	6040.
47	6453	Wine	NA	IP	yea that sounds fine for to me. 40 is...is good for me.
47	6454	Grocery	NA	QM	oh really?
47	6455	Wine	NA	RP	yea so I will be happy if we do that.
47	6456	Wine	NA	MIC	Ok so we agree on 40%.
47	6457	Wine	NA	MIN	Ok so we havewere staying open from 8:30 to 8:30. spend 25 thousand dollars on renovations. 40% for me 60% for you. 67 degrees and we open in August.
47	6458	Grocery	NA	MIN	Ok
47	6459	Wine	NA	QM	that sound good?
47	6460	Grocery	NA	MIC	good good.
47	6461	Wine	NA	MIC	ok I guess were all set then.
47	6462	Grocery	NA	MIC	sounds good.
48	6463	Grocery	American	MIC	Hi
48	6464	Wine	East Asian	MIC	HI
48	6465	Grocery	American	P1	how about we first discuss the renovation costs?
48	6466	Wine	East Asian	P1	I think hours is better.
48	6467	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Cause like depends on the hours of operation that were gonna get will also determine like grand opening date.
48	6468	Wine	East Asian	P1	"""Well actually,renovation will be fine too."
48	6469	Grocery	American	IP	Ok I think its best that try and keep it as low as possible
48	6470	Grocery	American	SBR	cause i dont think it needs a lot of work.
48	6471	Grocery	American	SBR	We should try and save our money and use it on something else.
48	6472	Grocery	American	OS	So I think 10 thousand dollars would work well for both of us.
48	6479	Grocery	American	SBR	Well I think the location helps a lot in bringing people in. So they dont really need to see something extremely fancy. Theyre going to be interested in coming.
48	6480	Grocery	American	SBR	I think it would work better by looking nice on the outside but not over the top
48	6481	Grocery	American	OS	so maybe we can bump it up to 15
48	6481	Grocery	American	OS	or maybe even 20 if that would work
48	6482	Wine	East Asian	SBR	well also for the location toothat it is a nice place. You dont wanna to look worse than the other places around you in order toin order to attract customers.
48	6483	Wine	East Asian	SBR	So I mean I think we should decorate as much as we can on the outside and also keep it clean and organized as possible on the inside.
48	6484	Wine	East Asian	OS	so Im gonna stick with 30 thousand.
48	6485	Grocery	American	QM	really?
48	6486	Wine	East Asian	OS	maybe 25 about...
48	6487	Grocery	American	SBR	Its really pretty out of my budget to be going that high.
48	6488	Grocery	American	SBR	I think that it would work better if we tried to cut some other costs
48	6489	Wine	East Asian	OS	25 maybe?
48	6490	Grocery	American	OS	Id be willing to go to 20.
48	6491	Wine	East Asian	RN	No.
48	6492	Wine	East Asian	OS	We need to go to 25.
48	6493	Grocery	American	QM	25?
48	6494	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Cause it is I mean at this moment it would be a lot of money to pay at once but    Im sure its gonna payoff in the long term.
48	6495	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Cause it is a nice place,people are gonna come if its attractive. More people will come by."
48	6496	Grocery	American	MIN	Yea.
48	6497	Grocery	American	SBR	Well I think that its not really falling apart right now.
48	6498	Grocery	American	SBR	And if we spend too much money were not going to really be able to keep it looking nice inside.
48	6499	Grocery	American	SBR	You know we could spend a bit more money and have like a nice opening or something like thatthat would bring more people in
48	6500	Wine	East Asian	MIN	well renovation
48	6501	Grocery	American	SBR	you could use the money for samples you know.
48	6502	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""well thing is we dont,we cantwell for the groceries we can out some fast foods but howre we gonna give out the wines you know?"
48	6503	Grocery	American	SBR	Yea well you can always do wine tasting. People do that.
48	6504	Grocery	American	OS	So I think 20 would be best.
48	6505	Grocery	American	SBR	You dont want to blow the budget right off.
48	6506	Wine	East Asian	PM	How about we come back to that one?
48	6507	Wine	East Asian	IP	Cause I wanna stick with 25.
48	6508	Grocery	American	MIN	Ok
48	6509	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Things
48	6510	Wine	East Asian	QP	How about floor space then?
48	6511	Grocery	American	MIN	yea
48	6512	Wine	East Asian	INP	because its the wine that we have and yours is groceries. You probably need more space. I dont need that much space.
48	6513	Wine	East Asian	IP	I want just 40%.
48	6514	Grocery	American	QM	40%?
48	6515	Grocery	American	QM	Which would give me 60%?
48	6516	Grocery	American	RP	Ok that sounds fine.
48	6517	Grocery	American	P1	How about the temperature?
48	6518	Grocery	American	IP	I kinda want it to be a warmer temperature.
48	6519	Grocery	American	SBR	Because it would keep my stuff...it would keep it better
48	6520	Grocery	American	SBR	and it would cost less on air conditioning.
48	6521	Grocery	American	SBR	I dont think that you need it to be too cold because you can always use something like refrigerators if you have to have wine selling it for that day.
48	6522	Grocery	American	SBR	And otherwise I think wine would keep fine in a warmer temperature.
48	6523	Grocery	American	IP	I think 73 degree would be prefect for me.
48	6524	Wine	East Asian	IP	Well the perfect degree for me would be 65
48	6525	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""because of some liquors...Not for the wine but some liquors need to to be kept at a cold,low temperature to be goodto be in good shape I guess."
48	6526	Grocery	American	MIN	well 65 degrees would
48	6527	Wine	East Asian	QS	Could beis that...would that be to cold?
48	6528	Grocery	American	SBR	I think it would be too cold.
48	6529	Grocery	American	SBR	Plus it would cost a lot of money for both of us on air conditioning.
48	6530	Wine	East Asian	OS	how about 67?
48	6531	Grocery	American	MIN	67
48	6532	Grocery	American	OS	maybe 69 would work better.
48	6533	Wine	East Asian	MIN	69
48	6534	Grocery	American	PC	Yea because its only about...its a 4 degree difference between both of our perfect temperatures.
48	6535	Wine	East Asian	SBR	yea but the 4 degree could affect the wine. Thats why Im concerning.
48	6535	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Cause with your food some of them arewill be in the refrigerator so it wouldnt really effect the groceries.
48	6536	Grocery	American	SBR	well most of it will be out because theyll be a lot of pastries you know and for it to be sitting out in a colder temperature. It just wouldnt make much sense because it needs to be warmer anyway...
48	6537	Grocery	American	SBR	"""I mean with the wine you  know,you can always keep it like in a box to keep it from getting too cold. I mean all of it doesnt need to be out on the shelf that day."
48	6538	Wine	East Asian	RP	I think 69 is ok.
48	6539	Wine	East Asian	P1	How about the hours of operation?
48	6540	Grocery	American	IP	Well I would like it to be earlier for me
48	6541	Grocery	American	SBR	because theyre a lot of pastries that need to be sold.
48	6542	Grocery	American	IP	So Im thinking opening around 6:30 and then closing around 6:30.
48	6543	Wine	East Asian	IP	I think thatll would be too early
48	6544	Wine	East Asian	SBR	cause it is a alcoholnobody drinks alcohol around 6 o clock.
48	6545	Wine	East Asian	IP	So best time for me would be 10:30 and close at 10:30.
48	6546	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Cause even myselfhave...i mean even if you go to theany liquor store if they close by 9 o clock no one is gonna come there,no one is gonna go there after work."
48	6547	Grocery	American	SBR	"""yea well a lot of people will be buying wine I think. And I think people who would be buying the wine will probably be coming in a little bit earlier and planning their dinner ahead,so the people who will be coming in really late will probably just, there, buy liquor anyway."
48	6548	Grocery	American	SBR	You might not even want them in the store anyway.
48	6549	Wine	East Asian	SBR	yea but I think 6:30 would be too early for us.
48	6550	Wine	East Asian	OS	How about 9:30?
48	6551	Grocery	American	IP	9:30?
48	6552	Grocery	American	IP	Opening at 9:30 is too earlyor too late for me still
48	6553	Grocery	American	SBR	because people are already done with breakfast and be off at work at that time.,
48	6554	Grocery	American	OS	I think the earliest would be 8:30.
48	6555	Wine	East Asian	QM	you mean the latest?
48	6556	Grocery	American	MIN	well yeayea
48	6557	Wine	East Asian	MIN	8:30yea..
48	6558	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""I think 8:30if we close at 8:30,I mean some people drink wine for the dinner but like were not just selling the wine were also selling liquors and stuff too."
48	6559	Wine	East Asian	SBR	People just passing by might just come stop by liquor or two.
48	6560	Wine	East Asian	IP	9:30 will be fine.
48	6561	Wine	East Asian	MIN	How about this then?
48	6562	Wine	East Asian	OM	Well open at 9:30 but push up the budget to 25?
48	6563	Wine	East Asian	MIN	I mean 8:30.
48	6564	Grocery	American	QM	open at 8:30 and push the budget to 25?
48	6565	Grocery	American	RP	"""Yea,I think that would work and then.."
48	6566	Wine	East Asian	P1	"""Ok,how about grand opening date?"
48	6567	Grocery	American	MIN	Well
48	6568	Wine	East Asian	IP	I want it to be early as possible
48	6569	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""so that we can just go ahead,start the business and make more money."
48	6570	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Well if were going to use the 25 thousand on the renovation costs,I think that if we had an earlier opening date then youd just be spending all the money on fixing it up as soon as possible, and paying peope a lot more money to get it taken care of too soon."
48	6571	Grocery	American	SBR	So I think by pushing back the grand opening date well be better able to used the renovation costs money and make it as nice as possible.
48	6572	Wine	East Asian	OS	So sometime in july
48	6572	Wine	East Asian	OS	or june?
48	6573	Grocery	American	IP	"""I think that sept,aug is better"
48	6574	Wine	East Asian	IP	I think that will be too late.
48	6575	Wine	East Asian	OS	"""July,what about july? July will be too early for you?"
48	6576	Grocery	American	IP	July would be too early for me.
48	6577	Grocery	American	SBR	Yea and then...think about it too...the air conditioning costs.. well be saving money by having it later too.
48	6578	Grocery	American	SBR	So overall just...either sept or aug will be saving us money. And working out a lot better.
48	6579	Wine	East Asian	SBR	well keeping at 69 degrees wouldnt be too much of air conditioning paying off.
48	6580	Wine	East Asian	OS	What about july?
48	6581	Grocery	American	SBR	well july is the hottest month.
48	6582	Wine	East Asian	SBR	July is not the hottest month. August is the hottest month.
48	6583	Wine	East Asian	SBR	So..and its gonna  cool off bye end of august so I dont think july is going to effect that much for the air conditioning.
48	6584	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Especially if were not keeping at the lowest,65."
48	6585	Wine	East Asian	QM	Were keeping it at 69 right?
48	6586	Grocery	American	MIN	Yea
48	6587	Wine	East Asian	MIN	So I dont think
48	6588	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Cause as I keep saying the faster we open,its better for both of us to go ahead and start on our business."
48	6589	Grocery	American	MIN	I dont know.
48	6590	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Well Id rather have like,a really good Grand Opening, thatll really attract people."
48	6591	Grocery	American	SBR	Like if we have people working on it and keep it looking nice for the first couple of months and then have a big openingI think people would be more interested and more likely to come in and check that out.
48	6592	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""but for august you know a lot of people go on vacations. Cause its summer. So wouldnt it be better to have more people come in on July,not August"
48	6593	Grocery	American	SBR	well that would just mean that August sales would start to slump anyway so.. I mean
48	6594	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""yea so we should bring as much as customers as we canwell thats why I was thinking,May would be better."
48	6595	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Like all those college students will come back from their home and want to shop too. So I was thinking May.
48	6596	Wine	East Asian	IDN	Well May is my best choice and thats not gonna work.
48	6597	Wine	East Asian	OS	"""Maybe JuneJune wouldnt be too,it wouldnt be too late either, I mean it wouldnt be too early."
48	6598	Wine	East Asian	SBR	And August I think will be too late and most of the people will leave by that time. And most of like students and overall.
48	6599	Wine	East Asian	SBR	And also a lot of people go on vacation for August.
48	6600	Wine	East Asian	SBR	And September everybodys too busy for work to...
48	6601	Grocery	American	SBR	Well I think like we shouldnt worry about students because a lot of them cant even drink and I dont think theyll be spending a lot of money on really good wineor any nice groceries.
48	6602	Grocery	American	SBR	I think we should try to focus on the people to...
48	6607	Grocery	American	SBR	Well I dont know.
48	6608	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Like,Having it in September people would be giving off work and coming back from vacation, they might want to treat themselves more."
48	6609	Grocery	American	SBR	"""And I think just starting,like if we start in August, it might just be too much of a slump. We really want the first month and the months after that to be a big seller."
48	6610	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Especially like by opening in September,we also have the holidays afterwards and I think a lot of people would be spending a lot of money then, on parties and things like that."
48	6611	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Yea but theres holiday in July too
48	6612	Grocery	American	MIN	well I dont know.
48	6613	Grocery	American	SBR	People dont really have a big July 4th like...fancy
48	6614	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""yea but the holidays not until like,November."
48	6615	Grocery	American	IP	yea well I think that we should try to have it later.
48	6616	Wine	East Asian	OS	"""I dont know,I think July."
48	6617	Grocery	American	MIN	July
48	6618	Wine	East Asian	PC	Because uh my first offer was May. Our first offers September. Were right in the middle so
48	6619	Grocery	American	RP	"""Ok,I guess July will have to be it then."
48	6620	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Were opening at 8:30,25, floor space 40..40 for me 60 for you. Temperature 69, grand openings July"
48	6621	Grocery	American	MIN	Ok

49	6670	Wine	East Asian	MIN	I mean among that
49	6674	Wine	East Asian	IR	"""Ok. ok,to me the most imp I think is renovation costs."
49	6675	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""Should be fancy you know. So all the good display andyea,you know."
49	6676	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""The customer,think the good display would be connected to the good quality of the wine so"
49	6677	Grocery	America	MIC	the quality of wine...yea.
49	6678	Grocery	America	INN	And you want to attract the high level clientele.
49	6679	Wine	East Asian	QR	so I want to know it is uhmost important to you.
49	6680	Grocery	America	PC	"""yea I think that renovation costs and how much you want to spend is definitely something that,that I can work with."
49	6681	Grocery	America	PP	And i think that sort of goes hand in hand with when we open.
49	6682	Grocery	America	PP	"""If we want to spend a little bit more money on renovations and getting things set,we probably should open a little bit later so we can really make sure theres enough time to get everything finished before, before we open."
49	6683	Grocery	America	QP	What were you thinking of spending in terms of renovation...like what?
49	6684	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""frankly I,I want to investigate as much as possible, you know, in my amount."

49	6690	Grocery	America	PM	but maybe thats something we can come back to and just sort of looking at. To make it cost effective.
49	6691	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Cause they say within the first year like most,you know, businesses go out of business within the first year if you dont have a good start so...."
49	6692	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""yea so...ok now I know at least what your,I mean your exportability of"
49	6693	Wine	East Asian	QR	So how about the hours of operationsits the most important thing right?
49	6694	Grocery	America	IR	thats important as well.
49	6694	Grocery	America	SBR	Being a grocery store I hope to be able to sell
49	6695	Wine	East Asian	MIN	The right kind of
49	6696	Grocery	America	SF	donoughts and coffee; things in the mornings.
49	6697	Grocery	America	IP	So I would prefer to be open earlier in the morning. As early as possible. And then its not as important for me to be open late in the evening.
49	6698	Grocery	America	INP	I imagine your probably different cause people like to buy wine later at night dont they?
49	6699	Wine	East Asian	IDN	Opposite
49	6700	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I mean groceries and liquors has different kinds of stuff.
49	6701	Grocery	America	SBR	but most people would be buying wine for dinner right? So its not like a beer shop that theyll want it real late at night.
49	6702	Grocery	America	SBR	"""But perhaps,to be able to buy for dinner or hors dourves."
49	6703	Grocery	America	QB	So what would be the earliest time that you would be happy closing at night time?
49	6704	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I think,I think, I mean9:30s fine."
49	6705	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""9:30s fine but I,I dont think any customer will be___ you know in the liquor store. If, if it is, then he has some problems you know?"
49	6706	Grocery	America	MIN	Yea.
49	6706	Grocery	America	MIN	thats true.
49	6707	Grocery	America	IR	Personally this is quite important just..
49	6708	Grocery	America	SBR	Most people go to work at 9 o clock so I think itd be great to be open before 9 o clock in the morning
49	6709	Grocery	America	SBR	"""cause even people might want to pick up wine on their way to work,you know, in the morning so they can have it, you know, go home immediately after work or that kinda thing."
49	6710	Grocery	America	IP	So I would really like to be open at 8:30 and close at 8:30 pm.
49	6711	Grocery	America	IP	"""But if,and I would prefer earlier, 6:30 or 7:30."
49	6712	Grocery	America	OS	"""but knowing that you want to be open,maybe something like 7:30 to 7:30?"
49	6713	Grocery	America	CS	"""I think itd be great to look at eventually maybe having different hours on,you know, Thursday, Friday nightyou know, but just to start we have to keep, keep the same hours "
49	6714	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""and then we can check how it goes,you know."
49	6715	Grocery	America	MIN	"""So,lets see."
49	6716	Grocery	America	PO	"""I guess lets just talk about the last,kinda issues that are imp to us and then maybe we can come to some conclusions on which things wed be willing to give and what works."
49	6717	Grocery	America	QP	How much space did you need for your wine?
49	6717	Grocery	America	MIN	Just like?
49	6718	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I mean,frankly I dont need the big space. Just 30 or 40 is alsogood."
49	6719	Wine	East Asian	QP	How about you? Do you need big space or?
49	6720	Wine	East Asian	IP	Grocery,yea I would prefer more space.
49	6721	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""You know,just having, you know, groceries, it takes more space."
49	6722	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""And we can always integrate you,putting the wine, mixed in    a little more."
49	6723	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yea 60% of the space would be great with me.
49	6724	Wine	East Asian	OS	So youd be happy with 40%?
49	6725	Wine	East Asian	RP	yea
49	6726	Grocery	America	MIC	"""ok then lets,lets definitely do that."
49	6727	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok
49	6728	Grocery	America	MIC	oh thats good.
49	6729	Grocery	America	MIN	"""What,I know like electrical bills, well be sharing all that."
49	6730	Grocery	America	QP	So what are your for wine. Like what temp would we want to keep the store at?
49	6731	Grocery	America	IP	Wine,I mean most degree for temperature is 65 but 65 degrees...all were increasing is not big deal to me I think..,
49	6732	Grocery	America	INP	"""and that has to do with keeping the wine,at akeeping it from spoiling, you want to keep the wine at a cool temperature."
49	6733	Grocery	America	QM	Is that the idea?
49	6734	Wine	East Asian	MIN	yea thats my idea.
49	6735	Wine	East Asian	QP	How about groceries?
49	6740	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""I mean,so I mean, my preferred time, my preferred temperature, I mean its very subtle temperature for using the refrigerator you know."
49	6741	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""Just the 65 or little less 65 so,so just.."
49	6742	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""And a lot for wines has same conditions,needs same conditions sosojust to"
49	6743	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""I agree maybe it could be maybe its ok to have to contain,I mean to, to keep the low mark condition for the customer rather than for the wine."
49	6744	Wine	East Asian	SBR	But not so high because the wine could be a little different or
49	6745	Grocery	America	SBR	so we could do the temp higher than 65 but maybe put the wine in the like the refrigerator section in
49	6746	Wine	East Asian	RN	no I dont think so
49	6747	Grocery	America	SBR	not actually in the refrigerator but if we can keep it somewhat cooler.
49	6748	Grocery	America	QB	Whats the highest temperature that you can keep wine at and it would be ok?
49	6749	Grocery	America	MIN	I dont know much about wine. Im not an expert.
49	6750	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I mean,just low temperature is better."
49	6750	Wine	East Asian	OS	Maybe 6769 is ok or
49	6751	Grocery	America	QP	69 would be ok but youd prefer lower?
49	6752	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yea.
49	6753	Wine	East Asian	QP	What about you?
49	6754	Grocery	America	IP	"""Well like I was saying,Im happy keeping it just sort of even hotter; 71, 73. Something thats more normal."
49	6755	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Because anything that I have to have cooled,Ill have refrigerators."
49	6756	Grocery	America	OS	So maybe we can think about 67,
49	6756	Grocery	America	OS	or 69 and then look at how we,where we put the wine so that we can just check on the temperature.
49	6758	Grocery	America	SBR	or 69 and then look at how we,Ive been to grocery stores where they have freezers that are open. And then they have shelves above it so the coolness kinda comes up and sorta refrigerates the area.
49	6758	Grocery	America	MIN	So we can think about something like that.
49	6759	Grocery	America	SBR	"or 69 and then look at how we,""But yea,I see what you mean, we dont want it to be maybe 73 cause we want it to consistently lowerthat makes sense."
49	6760	Grocery	America	PP	"or 69 and then look at how we,""Um...ok so lets see hereSo could we,for grand opening and the cost that we want to spend, could we go ahead and push it as late as possible. Not open till sept 1st? and that would give me more time to get the money that I could contribute more to the renovation."
49	6761	Grocery	America	OM	or 69 and then look at how we,So would you be happy spending 20 or 25 thousand each on renovation and not opening until sept 1st?
49	6762	Wine	East Asian	RN	"""frankly I already have all,plenty of wine."
49	6763	Wine	East Asian	IP	So I would prefer a little early opening.
49	6764	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Because renovations doesnt take long time maybe if we spend a little more money so...
49	6765	Wine	East Asian	IP	Frankly I want a little earlier opening.
49	6766	Wine	East Asian	QP	But you want a late opening right?
49	6767	Grocery	America	IP	yea.
49	6768	Grocery	America	QB	So what would be thewhat would be the latest that you would be happy opening?
49	6769	Grocery	America	OS	Could we open like say aug 1st?
49	6770	Wine	East Asian	QM	July or Aug?
49	6771	Grocery	America	MIN	July or Aug.
49	6772	Grocery	America	RP	"""Ok,yea I think July or Aug would work for me."
49	6773	Grocery	America	PO	So lets plan on July or Aug.
49	6774	Grocery	America	PP	And if we open earlier Im not going to be able to get as much money for renovations so...thats gonna be kinda tied together so
49	6775	Wine	East Asian	MIN	so how about stick.. so
49	6776	Wine	East Asian	IR	frankly I have more priority in renovations.
49	6778	Wine	East Asian	PP	"""so how about spending 30 thousand but I can,I can"
49	6779	Grocery	America	QM	you can push back the opening?
49	6780	Wine	East Asian	MIN	yea
49	6782	Wine	East Asian	QM	"""sept 1st,not aug?"
49	6783	Grocery	America	MIC	yea...aug would work ok.
49	6784	Grocery	America	OM	Then lets do aug 1st and..
49	6785	Wine	East Asian	RP	ok..Sept is ok.
49	6786	Grocery	America	QM	Sept would be ok?
49	6787	Grocery	America	RP	That would be really great for me. Be able to get the 30 thousand dollars.
49	6787	Grocery	America	MIC	That sounds good.
49	6788	Grocery	America	MIC	So we both get our highest priority worked out.
49	6789	Grocery	America	MIN	So lets do sept 1st and Ill get 30 thousand dollars and
49	6790	Wine	East Asian	OM	and floor space is 60 and 40
49	6791	Grocery	America	MIC	and 40..and your happy with that?
49	6792	Grocery	America	MIN	Ok.
49	6793	Grocery	America	PO	So then the last thing we need to work on is our hours of operation and temperature.
49	6794	Wine	East Asian	OS	So.. you said 8:30 is ok?
49	6795	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Or what did you say about the hours of
49	6796	Grocery	America	RP	8:30 would be ok.
49	6797	Grocery	America	IP	I would prefer
49	6798	Wine	East Asian	QP	A little earlier?
49	6799	Grocery	America	IP	7:30. Yea the earlier the better. But 7:30 Id prefer.
49	6800	Grocery	America	IB	8:30 would be the latest that I would want to open.
49	6801	Grocery	America	SBR	Just so people could go before work and get their cup of coffee and stuffand maybe even shop for dinner before work if they needed to.
49	6802	Grocery	America	INN	So and I know you wanted to close as late as possible.
49	6802	Grocery	America	MIN	So..
49	6803	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""Yea,I prefer 9:30"
49	6804	Wine	East Asian	PO	but just the...how aboutjust opinion to 8:30 is it ok?
49	6805	Grocery	America	PO	"""lets,Yea ..lets hold that."
49	6806	Grocery	America	PP	Lets think about the 8:30 time might work. Maybe we can reach a compromise between that and the temperature.
49	6807	Grocery	America	PP	"""Cause I know were kinda at a little disagreement about the temperature as well. Cause thats actually going to be sort of related. If were open earlier Ill make more money,probably, to have more money to spend on air conditioning or what not. And if were open later, youll probably sell more wine so youll probably do better. So those are sort of connected."
49	6808	Wine	East Asian	IR	"""So,to me, the hours of operations is really important right?"
49	6809	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Like the temperature.
49	6810	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Theyre similar to me but...I mean to youI mean,ok sorry."

49	6818	Grocery	America	PO	okwere almost done
49	6819	Wine	East Asian	PP	"""Yea sohow about just do,a little decrease temp and a little ..little ..open the store earlier?"
49	6820	Grocery	America	OM	so we could perhaps open atlets see hereWhat about keeping it would you be ok 7:30 to 7:30 but keeping the temp at 67 degrees?

49	6823	Wine	East Asian	QM	so you prefer the 7:30 and 67 degrees rather than 8:30 and 69 degrees?,
49	6825	Wine	East Asian	MIN	almost similar.
49	6826	Grocery	America	QM	theyre almost the same?
49	6827	Wine	East Asian	MIN	yea.

49	6829	Grocery	America	OM	"""yea,I kind of thought this thing to well hrs of ops and temp can easily be changed later as we look at our, at our bills so..yea so if that about he same, I suggest we go for the 7:30 and 67 degrees."
49	6830	Grocery	America	MIC	Would you be happy with that?
49	6831	Wine	East Asian	RP	ok
49	6832	Grocery	America	MIN	yea
49	6833	Wine	East Asian	MIN	thats no big deal to me
49	6834	Grocery	America	MIC	and hopefully we can sell lots of wine at 7:30 in the morning.

50	6857	Wine	American	QM	Are those the things that are kind of on your mind right now? ,

50	6863	Wine	American	IP	Grocery,my ideal time would be from 6:30 to 6:30pm.,

52	7249	Wine	American	PO	"""So we need to work out a agreement here about,all these different issues."
52	7250	Wine	American	P1	I guess we probably have to start with the first one which is the hours of operations...
52	7251	Wine	American	SBR	"""I was thinking because,Im a wine shop and I have, you know this liquor that people are probably gonna wanna buy later"
52	7252	Wine	American	IP	"""so I was thinking like,10:30 am to 10:30 pm?"
52	7253	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Well because Im a grocery shop and I sell coffee and breakfast stuff.
52	7254	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So I was thinking more like 6:30 to 6:30.
52	7255	Wine	American	RN	oooh yea see
52	7256	Grocery	East Asian	IDN	I think we have like opposite hours.
52	7257	Wine	American	RN	"""Yea yea,I mean obviously that wont work for me."
52	7258	Wine	American	MIN	"""Because 6:30,probably like 9:30s probably like my biggesttype"
52	7259	Wine	American	SBR	plus I feel like what people are going to want to buy groceries at night too so people coming for wine and theyre gonna want to come in for
52	7260	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""the reason why I say 6:30 is,because breakfast hours. And 6:30 I might have like more breakfast buyers."
52	7261	Wine	American	MIN	yea I mean like you also can have like
52	7262	Grocery	East Asian	OS	"""I mean,I think 7:30 might work out because you know people wont buy"
52	7263	Wine	American	MIN	I mean
52	7264	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I,Im not, Im not saying people wont buy wine at like 7"
52	7265	Wine	American	SBR	"""Yea I mean thats kinda early,no ones going to buy wine at 7:30 in the morning."
52	7266	Grocery	East Asian	OS	Im more thinking like 7:30
52	7266	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	at night because maybe people might go to wine shop and then start.  Maybe have little parties afterwards.
52	7266	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Cause 10:30s probably too late to buy wine
52	7267	Wine	American	MIN	I mean
52	7268	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	for whatever occasions you know.
52	7269	Wine	American	OS	"""well then how about,I mean what if we do like 8:30 to 8:30?"
52	7270	Wine	American	OS	Or 9:30 to 9:30?
52	7271	Grocery	East Asian	OS	How about 7:30
52	7271	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	cause 8:30s really late.
52	7272	Wine	American	RN	"""Oooh I,we cant and"
52	7273	Wine	American	SBR	Cause 7:30s so early cause like people are just getting off of work and its like Dupont Circle.
52	7274	Wine	American	SBR	People dont get of work until like 7 at least.
52	7275	Wine	American	SBR	Because people work a lot cause they have expensive bills to pay.
52	7276	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""Right,yea I understand what you are"
52	7277	Wine	American	IP	"""Yea,so I mean I think that 8:30 to 8:30 will beand 8:30s still really early unfortunately."
52	7278	Grocery	East Asian	IP	8:30 am is late for me already.
52	7279	Wine	American	MIN	"""Yea,see 8:30 pm,"
52	7280	Wine	American	IP	7:30s just too early.
52	7280	Wine	American	RN	I cant do 7:30.

52	7282	Grocery	East Asian	IP	7:30s pm is too early.
52	7283	Wine	American	IP	Yea 7:30s pm is just too early for me to close.
52	7284	Grocery	East Asian	OS	alright lets work on 8:30 then.
52	7285	Wine	American	QM	8:30?
52	7286	Wine	American	RP	Ok.

52	7289	Wine	American	MIN	"""Oh,yea."
52	7290	Wine	American	P1	"""Alright,so then next thing is renovation."
52	7291	Wine	American	IP	Now I dont care how much it cost
52	7292	Wine	American	SBR	because I think that its imp to have a nice looking store front and store because it in a much more higher class area. And so people will expect more.
52	7293	Wine	American	IP	So Im willing to spend 30 thousand dollars on renovations.
52	7294	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	right.
52	7295	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Let me double check my
52	7296	Wine	American	MIN	hmmm?
52	7297	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	let me double check my
52	7298	Grocery	East Asian	RN	Ok well Im Im more...Im thinking more like.
52	7299	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Because,since we already have the store, and were there already. Its more like connecting them and do little stuff."
52	7300	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So I would like like to minimize the cost as much as possible.
52	7301	Wine	American	QM	really?
52	7302	Wine	American	MIN	But like I feel like
52	7303	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	no I understand your 30 thousand dollars. Like I understand you want to be nice...like me too.
52	7304	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Because Im like a good quality grocery store.
52	7305	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""But you know,its just its just connecting...I mean the money would only be like connecting the store and saying werein huge for ussaying were combined and stuff like that so."
52	7306	Wine	American	SBR	"""yea,I mean, but dont you think that people are going to kind of expect that from us since were both like high end businesses..."
52	7307	Wine	American	MIN	And arent people going to
52	7308	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	but we already have the store. We already have our renovated stores already
52	7309	Wine	American	SBR	"""I mean its not really renovated,it still needs like a lot of work to it so."
52	7310	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	well I dont think 30 thousand
52	7311	Wine	American	OS	may be 25 thousand; would that be better?
52	7312	Wine	American	QP	How much were you willing to spend?
52	7313	Grocery	East Asian	IP	10 thousand
52	7314	Wine	American	RN	10 thousand!

52	7316	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I mean like...its just connetiLike I said,its just connecting them."
52	7317	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""So 30 thousand,or anything more than 10 thousands a little too much."
52	7318	Wine	American	SBR	"""really,well I mean that kind of stuff is expensive like."
52	7319	Wine	American	SBR	"""I mean,were both high end businesses and we both"
52	7320	Grocery	East Asian	OT	wait is this renovations cost for both of us or just each of us?
52	7321	Wine	American	MIN	I think its probably for each spends the amount. Because we want to put in the same amount oflike capital or whatever.
52	7322	Wine	American	IP	So I really want to spend more money
52	7323	Wine	American	SBR	cause I really think its really imp.
52	7324	Wine	American	SBR	"""Especially since were likeLike Dupont is justLike,I dont know if your from the area but like its highly visible to everybody. Like everyones going to be seeing it and I think that a lot of times when you have."

52	7343	Wine	American	SBR	We need to really come with a strong foot in the door.
52	7344	Grocery	East Asian	IR	I think maybe we should spend more time on the grand opening than the renovations.

52	7401	Grocery	East Asian	QS	why would you want it to be sooner?
52	7402	Wine	American	SBR	only because I just think we really need to get a start on this.
52	7403	Wine	American	SBR	And so.. and well  have plenty of time with renovations and the sooner the better.
52	7404	Wine	American	SBR	We might as well jsurt start making money now so...
52	7405	Wine	American	QS	Do you have any qualms against that or?
52	7406	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""well the reason I would like it to be later,the later the better."
52	7407	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Cause Im ordering some items from abroad.
52	7408	Grocery	East Asian	SBE	And I also need to hire a lot of people for my store.. to like do some organize stuff so

52	7419	Wine	American	MIN	I mean its like a..
52	7420	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""as well wait another 4 months,5 months."
52	7421	Wine	American	SBR	"""I mean,noif its just sitting...I mean we have it and, Id like to start making some money."
52	7422	Wine	American	SBR	Were going to have to close our wine shop and thats going to leave like six months of basically not having any type of revenues or profits or anything. Were just going to be spending money. So I think for both of us it would be more convenient to open it now.

52	7434	Wine	American	SBR	"""yea,I mean well just maybe not have those few items when we first open and then offer them later, once we open. Cause Im ready to go like right now so..."
52	7435	Grocery	East Asian	QS	but do you think youll have enough people for me and?
52	7436	Wine	American	MIC	yea!

52	7453	Wine	American	MIN	Its a
52	7454	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	but theyre be a lot of people too due to Dupont Circle so
52	7455	Wine	American	RP	ok we can do July 1st
52	7456	Grocery	East Asian	P1	"""Alright,back to renovations"
52	7457	Wine	American	MIN	ok yes.

52	7458	Wine	American	IP	"""I mean,Im still really going for 25 thousand"
52	7459	Wine	American	SBR	cause I really think that like the look of the store and the quality of our store
52	7460	Wine	American	SBR	and the inside of it is really going to...you know. Kind of help us with what we need.
52	7461	Wine	American	SBR	"""Cause we really need to have like,a bigger, a better, and nicer, and a higher quality looking store cause then people will actually come in. Cause its in a highly visible area. People are going to be walking by it everyday and theyre going to be walking by a thousand other shops."
52	7462	Wine	American	SBR	"""We have to get somethingWe need to spend extra money to,you know, make people want to come to our store."

52	7464	Wine	American	MIN	We have a
52	7465	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""but then that renovation costs,we might not get it back."
52	7466	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	This is kind of like high risk.
52	7467	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Cause,we arent sure how much business well get for, forever. So thats why I dont want to put much risk, or much investment into renovation costs."
52	7468	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Cause even if I were to spend that much I rather it be spend it on other things such as like hiring more people or like ordering more items.
52	7469	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	And just currently the space needs some exterior work and some interior work so... Its not like were building a store out of nowhere
52	7470	Grocery	East Asian	RN	"""so I dont,I dont think 30 thousand."
52	7470	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I think 30 thousand is a little too much so
52	7471	Wine	American	IP	"""ok well I think that,I mean I think that 25 thousand would be a really good amount then."
52	7472	Wine	American	SBR	If were gonna kind of like negotiate only because

58	8212	Wine	America	MIN	Looks like.,
58	8213	Wine	America	IR	I think it would be the renovation costs.,
58	8214	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	renovation costs.,
58	8215	Wine	America	QR	what would your most important be?,
58	8216	Grocery	East Asian	IR	"""for me,I would say...Well Ive go two. Yea for me hours of operations and grand opening date would be kind of important."","
58	8217	Wine	America	MIN	Ok,
58	8218	Grocery	East Asian	QS	So why would the renovation costs be most important to you?,
58	8219	Wine	America	SBR	I just believe its very important to present you know a very attractive looking store which would likeon entering the store,
58	8220	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""Ok,yea I guess the expectations are a bit high for selling wineyour projecting that through, like and impression of classI see."","

58	8223	Wine	America	QS	ok and why do you say grand opening date? Why is that very important?,
58	8224	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""So the one reason is that I might be importing from like other countries and it will take some time to actually ship all the,the material."","
58	8225	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	And also I would like to make sure we have enough time to train and hire good employees and have enough time to train them.,
58	8226	Grocery	East Asian	INP	Actually that would be pretty important for you too I would suppose.,
58	8227	Wine	America	MIN	Sure,
58	8228	Grocery	East Asian	IP	for me it would be best to start as late as possible which would be like Sept 1st.,
58	8229	Wine	America	IP	Ok Im thinking a little bit earlier on that,
58	8230	Wine	America	PC	"""but Im able to,to compromise on that issues."","
58	8231	Wine	America	IR	"""Would you...I was just think hereso renovation costs,thats my important as grand opening date is for you."","
58	8232	Wine	America	IP	"""Renovation costs,I was thinking of spending 30 thousand."","
58	8233	Grocery	East Asian	QP	ok and less than that would be too little for you?,
58	8234	Wine	America	IP	"""less than that,yea I feel it wouldnt be what Im looking for in the store."","
58	8235	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	ok.,
58	8236	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""So for me,since food like poultry kind of thing that Im doing...its not that much of a cost actually, decorate the store and all that"","
58	8237	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So the lower the better.,
58	8238	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""But if you could give me the god for Sept 1st,I could give you 30 thousand I suppose."","
58	8239	Wine	America	RP	that works for me.,

58	8241	Wine	America	MIC	sure.,
58	8242	Wine	America	MIC	Thatll be fine.,

58	8245	Wine	America	MIC	"""Thats great man,that sounds neat."","
58	8246	Wine	America	IR	That was a major one.,

58	8248	Wine	America	QR	"""Ok,you put hours of operations as important?"","
58	8249	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	yea so the things that we have a lot of breakfast stuff to sell like coffee and then like pastries and like all those things.,
58	8250	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I mean,for those thing you actually cant sell them raw of course and have to be made in the morning."","

58	8252	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Exactly,the business man and all of those people."","
58	8253	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So for that reason it would be ideal for us to start the store at 6:30.,

58	8255	Wine	America	SBR	"""the issue,issue there is that, you know, were selling wine and liquor and our major clientele would want it open later."","
58	8256	Grocery	East Asian	QS	is that true though?,

58	8264	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	To offer themIt might actually be kind of a nice thing if you could actually go to a wine store and buy a little bit of wine and then like afterwards you could go straight to a party. And bring the wine too.,

58	8273	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I was thinking it may be a nice thing if they can drop by our store,have a little breakfast and then during that time they can think about, well maybe I have some time now so why not get some wine for the party after work."","

59	8421	Grocery	American	INP	but I understand thats a little bit late for you.,
59	8422	Grocery	American	MIN	Lets look at it this way.,
59	8423	Grocery	American	MIN	Youre a high class wine store right?,

59	8425	Grocery	American	MIN	Reality.. I would imagine the traffic that your going to get in the night is not the traffic you want.,
59	8426	Grocery	American	MIN	Were an upscale store right?,

59	8433	Wine	East Asian	SBR	So I think to run the store together and bringing the wine customers and at the same time purchasing like high product organic groceries from your store then it would cause more profits than we expect so..,

62	8865	Grocery	East Asian	INP	"""Maybe youre a wine shop maybe right so like you want to you want to open the store to late night because people go to your store at night usually,not in the morning right."","
62	8866	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	But I have to sell the breakfast and coffee for the people who come visit the company.,
62	8867	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""So for me the earlier,the earlier the better."","
62	8868	Grocery	East Asian	INN	"""So our renovation cost is around,usually wine store you need to look fancy, luxury."","
62	8869	Grocery	East Asian	IP	The grocery store I think I dont have to spend too much money for renovation cost and floor space too,
62	8870	Grocery	East Asian	IDN	and temperature maybe we have different idea about that and opening date.,
62	8871	Grocery	East Asian	PO	I just want to go over each by each and I want to listen to your suggestion and Ill give my suggestion.,
62	8872	Wine	America	MIC	"""Okay,alright, we can do that."","
62	8873	Grocery	East Asian	QP	So what do you think about hours of operation?,
62	8874	Wine	America	IP	Well youre right I would like to open a little bit later.,
62	8875	Wine	America	SBR	A wine shop wont do very well if it opens at 6:30 in the morning and closes at 6:30 at night.,
62	8876	Wine	America	IP	Butso preferably the later the better for me,
62	8877	Wine	America	INP	but I understand that you need to be able to sell breakfast and a wine shop in D.C. isnt the same as some other stores that are just selling beer for late night drinkers.,
62	8878	Wine	America	MIC	So usually people are coming into my store are drinking the wine with a meal that they have already planned out so they arent doing the last minute late night run thing.,
62	8879	Wine	America	OS	So can you open at 9:30 is that too late in the morning?,
62	8880	Grocery	East Asian	RN	9:30 is too late,
62	8881	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Because people come into company early.,
62	8882	Grocery	East Asian	QM	I think its 9 oclock right?,
62	8883	Grocery	East Asian	OS	Wine,But if you open at 8:30 so they could get to work at 9?,
62	8884	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	"""Yeah I think so,may suggestion isYeah I totally understand your situation."","

62	8887	Grocery	East Asian	OS	"""S0 I think my suggestion 8:30 because 8:30 people come into the,I mean usually people come into their company usually by 9 oclock and after 8:30 you have some, I mean,  you can serve some wine."","
62	8888	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Maybe you can .by 9 oclock.,
62	8889	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	I think it is going to be fine.,
62	8890	Wine	America	RP	"""Okay,alright, that works."","
62	8891	Grocery	East Asian	QP	How about renovation cost?,
62	8892	Wine	America	SBR	Well I honestly think that any money we are going to sink into renovating is going to come back to us in the long run. So I think renovation costs will pay for themselves eventually.,
62	8893	Wine	America	SBR	,And I know that you were are feeling that a grocery store doesnt need to look fancy but I dont know that that is necessarily true.,
62	8894	Wine	America	SBR	I mean there are grocery stores that spend more money on how they look and on appearances and are able to charge more for it.,
62	8895	Wine	America	SBR	So maybe you could actually make back some of the money we sink into renovation costs by charging a little bit more.,
62	8896	Wine	America	SBR	You are already connected to a wine shop thats kind of a higherend feel about the store anyway.,
62	8897	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I personally agree with that that,agree that we need renovation but my focus on renovation is I mean, not the fancy."","
62	8898	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I mean my concept of renovation is clean not fancy.,

62	8901	Wine	America	SBR	"""I mean no matter how it starts off its going to get dirty so well have to keep it clean anyway,but fancy might might bring in people that will spend more money in your grocery store."","
62	8902	Wine	America	SBR	It might allow you to charge more money.,

62	8909	Wine	America	QM	Does 25 work?,
62	8910	Wine	America	MIC	Okay.,
62	8911	Grocery	East Asian	QP	How about floor space?,

62	8916	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""I need I mean I need more employee and little more space,so"","
62	8917	Wine	America	SBR	But we still are going to be splitting the cost for utilities right down the middle.,
62	8918	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I mean in that case I can pay more.,
62	8919	Wine	America	MIN	I mean that isnt one of our issues but,
62	8920	Wine	America	QP	Well how much space would you like?,
62	8921	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""I think,as I told you I spend I need little bit more space, maybe 60 percent."","
62	8922	Wine	America	QM	So you want to do it 60/40?,
62	8923	Grocery	East Asian	OS	"""Yeah,60/40 for space."","
62	8924	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Is that a problem?,
62	8925	Wine	America	RP	"""Yeah,yeah I think thats ok."","
62	8926	Wine	America	MIC	""" Thats ok because I mean,you have a lot more products than I do."","
62	8927	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""Thats right,thats right."","
62	8928	Wine	America	MIC	"""And that is close to what were spending for the utilities so okay,I think 60/40 we can wok with that."","
62	8929	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Ok thats fine.,
62	8930	Grocery	East Asian	P1	What about temperature?,
62	8931	Wine	America	QP	What is your preference for temperature?,
62	8932	Wine	America	SBR	I know a lot of grocery stores need to be kept cool.,
62	8933	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah I have my temperature at uhh,
62	8934	Wine	America	QS	You have refrigerated products right?,
62	8935	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Thats true.,
62	8936	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Ahh you have a wine so you are serving only wine not beer.,
62	8937	Wine	America	SF	"""Right,in D.C. you can only sell wine or beer. So I am a wine shop."","
62	8938	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Oh really?,
62	8939	Grocery	East Asian	QP	So what is your suggestion?,
62	8940	Wine	America	IP	Well even wine it doesnt need to be refrigerated like beer does but it still keeps better in a cooler environment.,
62	8941	Wine	America	QS	""" Do your groceries need to be kept cool,or does it not matter for them as much?"","
62	8942	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""Well because we are selling a vegetable,some kind of fruit so maybe...I think it needs to be a little bit cold. I mean not cold I mean cool."","

62	8946	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Yes 65 is a little bit cold.,
62	8947	Grocery	East Asian	OS	What about 69?,
62	8948	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Its a big difference?,
62	8949	Wine	America	IP	That might be a little bit warm for my wines.,
62	8950	Wine	America	SBR	"""The thing is,because wine needs to be kept in a cool area to keep for a long time and if its too far, if its too warm it wont keep as well."","
62	8951	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""Some of my products shouldnt be like over,over 80 degrees"","

62	8954	Grocery	East Asian	INP	I understand your problem like your wine needs to be cold.,
62	8955	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	But I dont think 69 and 65 is not that different.,
62	8956	Wine	America	MIN	Okay.,
62	8957	Grocery	East Asian	OS	And after that I meanwe can say 69 works and after that if you have some problem we can change.,
62	8958	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""If you say 65 is fine,I mean  I dont think 65 and 69 is that different."","
62	8959	Wine	America	RP	"""Okay,alright we can go with 69 then."","

62	8961	Grocery	East Asian	QP	You want to open as soon as possible right?,
62	8962	Wine	America	SBR	Luckily I have most of my products already so for me its just a matter of getting ready to sell it
62	8962	Wine	America	IP	and if we can get the renovations done by May it would be nice.,

62	8966	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	and usually I have to higher some people to work for me.,

62	8968	Grocery	East Asian	OS	"""How aboutI think Junehow about July 1st,its really late?"","
62	8969	Wine	America	SBR	Well just because summer is a big wine selling season.,

62	8973	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah I think I need to hurry for opening,
62	8974	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	but I think I can hire and train people for opening for a month in that case,
62	8975	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	but probably I have to get some special items from other country.,
62	8976	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I mean it might take some time.,
62	8977	Wine	America	QS	Now are you able to sell other things in the meantime while you are waiting for some of those special items?,
62	8978	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Yeah I mean if I order special items out of the country so it might..usually the process is a little bit.,
62	8979	Wine	America	MIC	"""No,I understand I have to import things too so I know how it is."","
62	8980	Grocery	East Asian	OS	Ok thats good June 1st.,
62	8981	Wine	America	QM	Is June 1st ok?,
62	8982	Grocery	East Asian	RP	Yeah its fine.,
62	8983	Wine	America	RP	"""Alright,so that seems that it works for both of us."","
62	8984	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.,
63	8985	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Hi,
63	8986	Wine	America	MIC	Im Megan.,
63	8987	Wine	America	MIC	Nice to meet you.,
63	8988	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Nice to meet you too.,
63	8989	Wine	America	PO	Do you just want to go through each issue?,
63	8990	Grocery	East Asian	PO	I think we can start on our,
63	8991	Grocery	East Asian	PO	Lets prioritize one and we can probably come up with the others.,
63	8992	Wine	America	MIC	That sounds good.,
63	8997	Wine	America	QS	Is there a reason we have to wait so long for it?,
63	8998	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Because there are just more employees involved with the grocery store.,
63	8999	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	And if I dont have the employees ready and everything ready people come in they have a bad first impression of the store.,
63	9000	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Probably less people will come in the future.,
63	9001	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I think the first impression is very important.,
63	9002	Wine	America	MIC	Yeah I agree.,
63	9003	Wine	America	SBR	"""I just think that earlier the start,we can start making a profit too."","
63	9004	Grocery	East Asian	QP	"""Yeah,so what is your date?"","
63	9005	Wine	America	IP	For me May would be the best. The earlier the better.,
63	9006	Wine	America	MIN	Grocery,but I see.,
63	9007	Wine	America	SBR	I think as long as the renovations are done,
63	9008	Wine	America	QS	You dont think you can get employees before September?,
63	9009	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	It will be hard.,
63	9010	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	""" I mean,cause with the later date you can also have more advertising done on the radio"","
63	9011	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	and its better because people will stop by and notice this new store more often.,
63	9012	Grocery	East Asian	PX	So if youI can be more lenient on the other parts if you want to help me out on this one.,
63	9013	Wine	America	PO	Well do you want to discuss the other ones too and then you can kind of like decide.,
63	9014	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah,
63	9015	Wine	America	QP	Ok well what about the temperature?,
63	9016	Wine	America	IP	I mean the cooler the better
63	9016	Wine	America	SBR	because it preserves the wine better.,
63	9017	Wine	America	IP	So 65 degrees would be ideal.,
63	9018	Wine	America	IB	But I probably couldnt go much more than 67/because the stuff would go bad.,
63	9019	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	I totally agree with you and,
63	9020	Grocery	East Asian	OS	How about if we go up a little bit for 69?,
63	9021	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	How about if we go up a little bit for 69?,See like it would be very hard for me to take a low degree.,
63	9022	Grocery	East Asian	PC	How about if we go up a little bit for 69?,So we can meet in the middle point if you agree.,
63	9023	Wine	America	MIN	Umm.,
63	9024	Wine	America	SBR	69 just seems a lot warmer than 65.,
63	9025	Wine	America	SBR	I think like that if wine is not as good a quality it is bad for both of our businesses you know? I mean,
63	9026	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Oh definitely
63	9026	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	but red wines you dont need to keep them in the fridge.,
63	9027	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""And the liquors and vodka theyre fine,theyre totally fine."","
63	9028	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	You probably just need a very little fridge for beers and ice and your white wines you can keep them in the fridge,
63	9029	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	that will be more like inviting to the customers because they will be touching a cold white wine and for me it is a urge to drink it so,
63	9030	Wine	America	SBR	I think just it is important to keep the product though.,
63	9031	Wine	America	SBR	I think it is easier for a person to bring a coat into a grocery store or like a jacket and keep a little bit warmer if they are shopping and they get cold.,
63	9032	Wine	America	SBR	And like if the products are good thats whats more important to the people who are shopping.,
63	9033	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""Okay,I see."","
63	9034	Wine	America	IP	I can do 67,
63	9035	Wine	America	SBR	but I feel like 69 is going to be kind of a little too warm and risky to the product.,
63	9036	Wine	America	PO	Lets talk about all of them I guess and then well decide.,
63	9037	Wine	America	QP	How about floor space?,
63	9038	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Floor space?,
63	9039	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I guess Id go for 50.,
63	9040	Wine	America	IP	Id ideally like a little bit less like 40% would be better,
63	9041	Wine	America	SBR	"""just because wine doesnt take as much food,as much space up as food."","
63	9042	Wine	America	INP	I mean ideally you would want 50 percent.,
63	9043	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	40 percent for you.,
63	9044	Wine	America	MIN	And 60 for you.,
63	9045	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Because floor is very expensive considering like monthly payment and also during like snow days.,
63	9046	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	How much you pay for cleaning up the parking lot is also determined by your space.,
63	9047	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""So for me to take a lot of space it would be like a you know,continuous expenditure."","
63	9048	Wine	America	SBR	Right definitely but you would also probably have a higher profit just because food typically brings in more than,
63	9049	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Well I can always maximize my storage by more shelves and everything.,
63	9050	Wine	America	SBR	But I wouldnt even have enough product to really take up 50 percent of the space.,
63	9051	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.,
63	9052	Wine	America	SBR	So it would be like I am paying for more space that I am not really using.,
63	9053	Wine	America	SBR	You could use the space and you would be making money off the space you are using whereas I really wouldnt be making any more or less.,
63	9054	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Yeah I am just afraid that the extra space wont cover my continuous cost monthly and for every winter and summer.,
63	9055	Wine	America	SBR	I feel like when I am grocery shopping though when things are laid out properly it is easier to like shop and get the things that you want than it is if stuff is piled all the way up and you cant really reach it.,
63	9056	Wine	America	SBR	And it becomes hard for people like have little kids ore someone in a wheelchair.,
63	9057	Wine	America	SBR	And just for like a grocery store there is so much more product than there is for.,
63	9058	Grocery	East Asian	PP	Well if you can help me out in temperature or grand opening date I might be able to take up more floor space.,
63	9059	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	If I can if I can just lower my cost in temperature keeping the temperature I might be able to recover the local cost for paying the extra rent that Ill be paying for.,
63	9060	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Do you see what Im saying?,
63	9061	Wine	America	MIC	I do see what youre saying.,
63	9062	Wine	America	PO	Lets discuss the rest of them briefly too and try to see where we are on them.,
63	9063	Wine	America	P1	Umm for renovation
63	9063	Wine	America	SBR	I was thinking the more money we put into it the more money we will probably get out of it.,
63	9064	Wine	America	SBR	So I was thinking the more money we put into it the more well probably get out of it.,
63	9065	Wine	America	IP	"""So I would say 30,000 dollars to get our moneys worth for it."","
63	9066	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Okay.,
63	9067	Wine	America	SBR	I think you have to spend money to make money you know.,
63	9068	Wine	America	SBR	The nicer it looks people are going to feel like they are shopping in a better place and they are going to justify spending a good amount of money.,
63	9069	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Do you want to do it in the interior or exterior?,
63	9070	Wine	America	MIN	I think both.,
63	9071	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Like what would be your emphasis on?,
63	9076	Grocery	East Asian	IDP	Yeah you probably want fancy furniture and stuff whereas for me it is just shelves and shelves and shelves and shelves and counters
63	9076	Grocery	East Asian	MINEG	so wow.,
63	9077	Grocery	East Asian	RN	"""$30,000 dollars,thats a lot."","
63	9078	Wine	America	QP	Well what would you be looking to spend?,
63	9079	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Much less.,
63	9080	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""I would be go for 10,000"
63	9080	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"because for me shelves are not really costly."","
63	9081	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""And the outside is really nice too,so."","
63	9082	Grocery	East Asian	QP	And hours of operation?,
63	9083	Grocery	East Asian	INP	I understand you probably want to open up as late as you can because people dont wake up early in the morning too.,
63	9084	Wine	America	SBR	Go alcohol shopping right.,
63	9085	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	But I would need to start baking my pastries and bakeries and get things ready for people.,
63	9086	Wine	America	QP	So you would look at 6:30?,
63	9087	Grocery	East Asian	RP	Definitely.,

63	9109	Grocery	East Asian	OS	What if you do 71?,
63	9110	Wine	America	IB	I think 69 is the lowest.,
63	9111	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Because you can add the fridge and the electricity cost.,
63	9112	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Half of it would be mine.,
63	9113	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I would be covering your cost in electricity even if you are keeping a fridge and it would look good for your customer.,
63	9114	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	The cost will back to me.,
63	9115	Wine	America	IP	Id really rather do 69,
63	9116	Wine	America	SBR	because I think those 2 degrees could make a big difference but lets hold off on that one.,
63	9117	Wine	America	QP	ForWhat about renovation costs?,
63	9118	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Renovation cost?,
63	9119	Grocery	East Asian	PP	""" If I sacrifice my hours of operation,can you settle for a lower renovation cost?"","
63	9120	Grocery	East Asian	QB	What would be your limit?,
63	9121	Wine	America	IP	I would like to spend as much as possible
63	9121	Wine	America	SBR	just so that it would be important to business.,
63	9122	Wine	America	IP	""" So 30,000 is what I would be willing to spend for it."","
63	9123	Wine	America	OM	But maybe if you would be willing to spend more on renovation I would be willing to take 50 percent of the floor space
63	9123	Wine	America	SBR	so you would save on your rent cost then too.,
63	9124	Wine	America	SBR	""" Cause didnt you say you wanted less,50 percent of the floor space to be able to for the rent."","
63	9125	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Oh I thought we already settled that with the grand opening.,
63	9126	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Oh I see what youre saying
63	9126	Grocery	East Asian	RP	that would be great.,
63	9127	Grocery	East Asian	IR	But for hours of operation is really important to me too.,
63	9128	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Because if I dont get the food ready people probably will not come since people like want to start shopping now.,
63	9129	Wine	America	PC	I would be willing to compromise in hours of operation because I think,
63	9130	Grocery	East Asian	OS	Would you settle for 8:30?,
63	9131	Wine	America	RP	That sounds good to me.,
63	9132	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	So if we settle at 8:30,
63	9133	Wine	America	QM	Thats right in the middle for both of us right?,
63	9134	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.,
63	9135	Wine	America	RT	Cause you wanted to open at 6:30 so thats fair.,
63	9136	Grocery	East Asian	PP	If I open 2 hours late can you minimize your renovation cost?,
63	9137	Wine	America	SBR	"""Well Im opening 2 hoursI know your opening 2 hours later but I am opening 2 hours earlier than I want to,too."","
63	9138	Wine	America	SBR	So it is right in the middle for that so I think we are both kind of giving up the same thing.,
63	9139	Wine	America	SBR	But I think if we spend more on renovation that would help my business so I could probably afford more rent and take 50 percent of the floor space.,
63	9140	Wine	America	MIN	So you would want 50 percent of the floor space.,
63	9141	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Yes/but that renovation cost is very very high.,
63	9142	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I probably cant afford it right away because I am just a little grocery store.,
63	9143	Wine	America	OM	"""What about 25,000 and then I would take 50 percent of the floor space."","
63	9144	Wine	America	SBR	Which would end up saving you,
63	9145	Grocery	East Asian	PP	How about I cover all of your renovation.,
63	9146	Grocery	East Asian	PP	I mean I agree with you on your renovation cost and you let me open early. (Include with above),
63	9147	Grocery	East Asian	IR	Cause that is important to me.,
63	9148	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I am being very strict because I have to cook everything because otherwise I have nothing to sell.
63	9148	Grocery	East Asian	IR	So product is very important to me.,
63	9149	Grocery	East Asian	PP	""" If I give you 30,000 for renovation,can you give me my hours of operation?"","
63	9150	Wine	America	OM	"""Could we open at 7:30 and we could do $25,000 in renovation costs."","
63	9151	Wine	America	SBR	I dont know many people that go grocery shopping before 7:30.,
63	9152	Wine	America	SBR	And that way when they first come in at 7:30 or 8 their bread could be fresh.,
63	9153	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	People go shopping at 7:30 probably but then I cannot start cooking at 7:30.,
63	9154	Grocery	East Asian	PO	At least we should agree on what we did before.,
63	9155	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Grand opening August 1st is ok for you?,
63	9156	Grocery	East Asian	OM	So Ill take the 60 floor but youre going to give me the temperature right?,
63	9157	Wine	America	RN	I really cant do the 71.,
63	9158	Wine	America	SBR	I think it is going to make my product go too bad.,
63	9159	Wine	America	MIN	If you can do 69 degrees then Ill take,
63	9160	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I already delayed my grand opening date so,
63	9161	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	And Im taking extra floor space and,
63	9162	Wine	America	OM	I can take 50 percent of the floor space if you can do 69 degrees,
63	9163	Wine	America	SBR	because that is really important to me to get a good product.,
63	9164	Grocery	East Asian	OM	Then I have to start in September,
63	9165	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	because if I am taking 69 degrees then that will like an ongoing cost for me.,
63	9166	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	You see Im sacrificing a lot there.,
63	9167	Grocery	East Asian	SBE	You see I need September 1st otherwise it will be hard for me.,
63	9168	Wine	America	SBR	I just dont see how temperature is going to effect your cost for If we,
63	9169	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""So if you give me September 1st,I can do 69 degrees for you and I can take 60% of the floor space, I can give you a renovation cost of 25,000."","

63	9189	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Where you from?,
63	9190	Wine	America	OT	Germany.,
64	9191	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Hi.,

64	9193	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	My name is Cassie and Im from the grocery store that will be combining with your winery.,
64	9195	Wine	America	MIC	Yes Im Stacey and it appears that the winery is the ye ole wine shop.,

64	9197	Wine	America	MIC	Yes.,

64	9201	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""Well considering that I have a coffee shop that will open early,"","
64	9202	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So itd be best for me to open as early as I can.,
64	9203	Grocery	East Asian	INP	But I also take into consideration that you opened a winery and most people dont go in the morning.,
64	9204	Wine	America	MIN	Yes.,
64	9205	Grocery	East Asian	PC	And given the options that we have I would say we could come to asort of at a middle point.,
64	9206	Wine	America	MIC	I think that is totally reasonable yes.,
64	9207	Grocery	East Asian	RN	So I think 8:30 for me is too late.,
64	9208	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So I was thinking 7:30 am to 7:30 pm.,
64	9209	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Considering that most people dont go out anymore after 7:30. If they were going to plan to buy something they have bought it already.,
64	9211	Wine	America	MIC	Yes and I can definitely see your point about your coffee shop opening early.,
64	9212	Wine	America	PX	So umm I would probably be willing to do 7:30 as long as some of the other items work out well so,
64	9213	Grocery	East Asian	PO	Sure we could just put it down on there first.,
64	9214	Grocery	East Asian	P1	""" Well,I think we should talk about temperature next."","
64	9215	Grocery	East Asian	IR	Because temperature is not really a main problem for us,
64	9216	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	considering that most of the food in the grocery store will be fine like regular temperature.,
64	9217	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I am sure wine is the same way.,
64	9218	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah there isnt a huge variations in temperatures.,
64	9219	Grocery	East Asian	OS	So do you want to say like the normal temperature which is like what other stores usually have like 73 degrees around there.,
64	9220	Wine	America	SBR	"""73 is too warm,the wine does not do optimally above 70 degrees."","
64	9221	Wine	America	IP	Ideally it would be around 60 between 65 and 69 would be optimal.,
64	9222	Wine	America	SBR	"""Obviously,nobody wants customers to be freezing."","
64	9223	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Right so,
64	9224	Wine	America	IP	So 69 might be a little cool but 69 would certainly be fine.,
64	9225	Grocery	East Asian	RN	I think 69 is a little cold for some of my products,
64	9226	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"""like I would say vegetables and fruits they might get frozen,maybe not frozen but damaged by the cold."","
64	9227	Grocery	East Asian	OS	"""I would agree to 71 if that is ok with you"
64	9227	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	"since 1 or 2 degrees wouldnt make that much of a difference,right?"","
64	9228	Wine	America	PO	Yeah let me think lets put a little dot by that for now.,
64	9229	Grocery	East Asian	P1	Alright so what do you want to talk about next?,
64	9230	Wine	America	P1	The floor space.,
64	9231	Grocery	East Asian	QP	What do you think?,
64	9232	Wine	America	IP	Ahh definitely no more than 50 percent.,
64	9233	Wine	America	SBR	Do not need more than that other wise it is going to be a waste of space.,
64	9234	Wine	America	SBR	There is just not enough wine for to cover more than 50 percent.,
64	9235	Wine	America	IP	Anything less than that would certainly is certainly fine.,
64	9236	Grocery	East Asian	PO	Ok well since consider that you want the temper well we were talking about the temperature earlier right?,
64	9237	Wine	America	MIN	Yes.,
64	9238	Grocery	East Asian	QP	So you said you want the 69 degrees would be more likely?,
64	9239	Wine	America	MIN	Um hum.,
64	9240	Grocery	East Asian	OM	OK lets see if I give youUmm let me think.,
64	9241	Grocery	East Asian	OM	Ok if I take 60 percent of the space and Ill give you the 69 degrees would that work for you?,
64	9242	Wine	America	QM	Ok so 60 percent of the space for you and 69 degrees?,
64	9243	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Right,
64	9244	Wine	America	RP	Yes.,
64	9245	Wine	America	MIN	So Id get 40% of the floor space mathematically speaking and 69 degrees.,
64	9246	Grocery	East Asian	IR	Ok the next one will be the 2 most important one. One is for cost and the other one is grand opening date.,
64	9247	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Wine,Yes,
64	9248	Grocery	East Asian	P1	So umm I think we should talk about grand opening date first.,
64	9249	Grocery	East Asian	QP	What do you think?,
64	9250	Wine	America	IP	As far as the wine is concerned the earlier the better,
64	9251	Wine	America	SBR	because there is no real preparation for that. We basically just have to get the wine in and put them out.,
64	9252	Wine	America	INP	But I understand that you have more variable products.,
64	9253	Wine	America	INP	Timing is a little bit more of an issue for you.,
64	9254	Wine	America	IP	So my feeling is the earlier the better no earlier than May 1st but absolutely willing to go in the May June July area absolutely.,
64	9255	Wine	America	SBR	Grocery,Well I was thinking since I have to order stuff from oversea and that might take a little bit of time.,
64	9256	Wine	America	IP	If we could do umm lets say September that would be best for me,
64	9257	Wine	America	SBR	because I really want a time to plan out things and get my employees so we can all start and they are all prepared and nothing goes wrong.,
64	9258	Wine	America	SBR	And that would be beneficial for both of us.,
64	9259	Wine	America	RN	Well unfortunately I cant do September that is just too late.,
64	9260	Wine	America	IP	""" Id prefer July I would be willing to consider August 1st obviously,but September is just too late."","
64	9262	Grocery	East Asian	P1	Ok well umm lets talk about renovate 1st.,
64	9263	Grocery	East Asian	QP	"""What is your maximum,What do you prefer to spend on your? "","
64	9264	Wine	America	IP	"""Umm 20,000 would be reasonable as far as Im concerned. No less than 10,000."","
64	9265	Wine	America	MIC	Grocery,Right understand that.,
64	9266	Wine	America	SBR	Its got to look good.,
64	9267	Wine	America	SBR	It is very important especially in the Dupont Circle area where everything is very nice. Youve got a lot of up scale competition.,
64	9268	Wine	America	QP	,So what are you thinking for renovation costs?,
64	9269	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""I was actually thinking around 15 around there,but I guess were pretty close,"","
64	9270	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	because I dont think well need that much decoration.,
64	9271	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I think what is more important is how our service is are,
64	9272	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	and I believe that the day we open 1st would be the most important because the reason I chose September 1st is because that is the beginning of the whole school year and everything and I think people will be like buying more things,
64	9273	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	,because the weather is changing from like hot summer to like cold times.,
64	9274	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I would think people would drink more wine like later after like July you know.,
64	9275	Wine	America	PP	Well that would give us more time so if we could spend more on the renovations I might be able to consider September 1st.,
64	9276	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	True.,
64	9277	Wine	America	SBR	Because that would give them more time to install renovations because you dont want to rush through things.,
64	9278	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Right,
64	9279	Wine	America	IP	"""As far as renovations are concerned I would be willing to go up to 30,000 but I do not need to go that high."","
64	9280	Wine	America	OM	"""Umm 20,000 would be great. And then we could push the opening to September 1st if that works for you."","
64	9281	Wine	America	MIN	"Grocery,""Ummm,lets see."","
64	9282	Wine	America	RP	"""Yeah we could do that we could do 20,000."","
64	9283	Wine	America	QM	So then we would open our store at September 1st right?,
64	9284	Wine	America	MIN	Right.,
64	9285	Grocery	East Asian	P1	So umm I think we should talk a little bit more about the temperature.,
64	9286	Wine	America	MIN	Ok,
64	9287	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Because it really worries me that if it is too low it would be not that good for my products to stay fresh ok.,
64	9288	Wine	America	QM	We had said 69 degrees right?,
64	9289	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Right,
64	9290	Wine	America	OS	I could do 71.,
64	9291	Grocery	East Asian	RP	Ok sure!,
64	9292	Wine	America	MIC	Not any higher than that but 71 should be ok,
64	9293	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""OK well so far we have open from 7:307:30 ampm and then umm 20,000 renovation costs."","
64	9294	Wine	America	MIN	Yes,
64	9295	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	And umm 60 percent for me 40 percent for you in floor spacing.,
64	9296	Wine	America	MIN	Um hum,
64	9297	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	And 71 degrees which I think is pretty average shouldnt be any problem and then September 1st as our opening date.,
64	9298	Grocery	East Asian	PO	So do you want to take a minute to think about it first before we decide?,
64	9299	Wine	America	MIC	Yeah let me justOk I have no complaints let things as they stand now.,
64	9300	Wine	America	QM	How do you feel?,
64	9301	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Yeah I think I am content with the agreement.,
64	9302	Wine	America	MIC	I dont think anything is absolutely ideal but that means the compromiseswhich is reasonable.,
64	9303	Wine	America	MIC	We are not doing anything extreme.,
64	9304	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Alright!,
64	9305	Wine	America	MIC	"""Okay,I think were good then!"","
65	9306	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Hi.

65	9312	Grocery	America	MIC	Well I mean obviously like I said I am really excited but there are a come really important things I would like to work out with you.
65	9313	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Ok me too.
65	9314	Grocery	America	PO	So have a meeting.
65	9315	Wine	East Asian	PO	Yeah so just start?
65	9316	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Grocery,Sure!
65	9317	Wine	East Asian	P1	Well I guess the first thing that concerned me was the hours of operation.
65	9317	Wine	East Asian	QR	How much of an issue is that to you?
65	9318	Wine	East Asian	SF	I think because we sell the wines and the liquors
65	9318	Wine	East Asian	IP	the later the better so.
65	9319	Grocery	America	INN	Yeah I figured you would probably say that.
65	9320	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Of course,I am a bakery so I sell coffees things in the morning"
65	9320	Grocery	America	IP	I tend to serve morning customers.
65	9321	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Also at late times people study for some stuff.
65	9322	Grocery	America	MIC	"""Thats true,thats true I do have some evening studiers which is very helpful."
65	9323	Grocery	America	QP	""" So I dont know,so give me a number, what sort of hours are you looking for?"
65	9324	Wine	East Asian	IP	I prefer some later time like till 10:30 am.
65	9325	Wine	East Asian	MIN	So 
65	9326	Grocery	America	IP	Thats a little bit late for me.
65	9327	Wine	East Asian	QP	Whats your number?
65	9328	Grocery	America	PC	Well I do want to try get things open a little bit later for you
65	9329	Grocery	America	OS	so maybe I could. I could go to 7:30.
65	9330	Wine	East Asian	QM	7:30?
65	9331	Grocery	America	MIN	Yeah
65	9332	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Oh I think at that time people still I mean not enough people will come to get wine. People still enjoy the parties at late time.
65	9333	Wine	East Asian	SBR	And also I think you dont just do bakery right. You do other stuff?
65	9334	Grocery	America	SBR	Yeah cappuccinos andits kind of like a coffee shop with some groceries that you can buy as well.
65	9335	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Yeah so its a grocery shop then people will need something late orso I think maybe you can just open a little bit later.
65	9336	Grocery	America	OS	Well how about is 8:30 ok?
65	9337	Grocery	America	SBR	I mean boy I am really stretching it here.
65	9338	Wine	East Asian	RN	"""No,"
65	9338	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I mean 8:30 people will still I mean just after their dinner they havent started their party or drinking.
65	9339	Grocery	America	QS	You think so?
65	9340	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Yeah I think because people like to do some happy things at night.
65	9341	Grocery	America	PM	Ok well maybe we should come back to this.
65	9342	Grocery	America	IR	There are some other things that I dont know are really important to me and this isnt quite as important. Actually the biggest issue for me its very important is opening date.
65	9343	Grocery	America	IP	,I need to do it later it is really critical.,
65	9344	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Ok this is biggest issue for you
65	9345	Wine	East Asian	IR	I think the biggest issue for me is renovation cost.
65	9346	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""I just think that if we want to do this at a very later time,"
65	9347	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""if we want to be famous or be really well,"
65	9348	Wine	East Asian	IP	I think we should put a lot of money on the renovation.,
65	9349	Grocery	America	QM	Why?
65	9350	Grocery	America	SBR	"""Geez,I thought the shop was really nice. I mean you know it needs a little bit of work but I thought it was great."
65	9351	Grocery	America	SBR	Wine,I think it just didnt give everything on the decoration there. Because it is kind of a whole change because it is from some other things to this grocery and wine.
65	9352	Grocery	America	SBR	We should do some renovation let people know everything is here it is an easy shop you can stop by.
65	9353	Grocery	America	SBR	And I think in the long run the money will be paid back. So I think if we pay more we will get more.,
65	9354	Grocery	America	QP	Grocery,So how much are we talking?
65	9355	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I want to spend 30,000."
65	9356	Grocery	America	SBR	Well you know that is more than I planned on
65	9357	Grocery	America	MIC	but I agree a really nice renovation could be fun.
65	9358	Grocery	America	OS	"""But yeah I mean I think how about 25,000?"
65	9359	Grocery	America	MIN	I mean is that,
65	9360	Wine	East Asian	QM	"""25,000?"
65	9361	Grocery	America	SBR	That would help save me just a bit more.
65	9362	Wine	East Asian	OM	"""Well if you can give me 30,000 then I can put the time to 8:30 I think."
65	9363	Grocery	America	QM	To 8:30 you think so?
65	9364	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Okay.
65	9365	Grocery	America	RP	"""Yeah lets do that so lets agree,8:30 ampm and 30,000 renovations."
65	9366	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yes.
65	9367	Grocery	America	MIN	Okay.
65	9368	Wine	East Asian	MIC	And then the other things will be no problem.
65	9369	Grocery	America	IR	But anyway the grand opening date is really important to me
65	9370	Grocery	America	IP	and I would really really like to push it back to September 1st.
65	9371	Grocery	America	SBR	Ive got some products Id love to order
65	9372	Grocery	America	SBR	and I need to train some new employees.
65	9373	Wine	East Asian	QS	So you dont have any storage there right now?
65	9374	Grocery	America	SBR	Well I mean there are things that I have to order from foreign countries and they take a long time to get here.
65	9375	Grocery	America	SBR	And then if we have a grand opening and I have employees who dont know what they are doing that looks pretty bad.
65	9376	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Yeah thats true.
65	9377	Wine	East Asian	IP	I can consider but September is still too late.
65	9378	Wine	East Asian	OS	Can we do like Jul 1st or?
65	9379	Grocery	America	QS	Well why is it late for you?
65	9380	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Because I have everything in my storage
65	9381	Wine	East Asian	SBR	and I have all the employees. I dont want to train them.
65	9382	Wine	East Asian	QS	Why do you want to train all of the employees?
65	9383	Wine	East Asian	QS	Do you have them right now?
65	9384	Grocery	America	SBR	I need some new ones. I am not staffed enough right now.
65	9385	Wine	East Asian	QS	So you have some?
65	9386	Grocery	America	SBR	Yes I do.
65	9387	Wine	East Asian	IP	So I just think that September is not a good time for me. Its too late.
65	9388	Grocery	America	MIN	Its too late.
65	9389	Grocery	America	QP	Its going to be a real financial burden?
65	9390	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Uh huh.
65	9391	Grocery	America	MIN	I mean its really.
65	9392	Grocery	America	MIN	Im going to sustain.
65	9393	Grocery	America	SBR	Im not going to have the products in the store to by then.
65	9394	Wine	East Asian	SBR	But you have something and you can just open that and then do everything at the same time.
65	9395	Wine	East Asian	SBR	And this will also save you money because you can make money and then you get al the stuff.
65	9396	Grocery	America	P1	I guess actually that brings us to the issue of floor space. Which is your bringing stuff in from your warehouse.
65	9397	Grocery	America	SF	I have stuff as well.
65	9398	Grocery	America	QP	How much floor space do you need?
65	9399	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I have,I mean frankly I have already calculated everything and I only need 40 percent"
65	9400	Wine	East Asian	SBR	because I only sell wine and the liquors and I dont need too much space. Then like grocer I think.
65	9401	Grocery	America	IP	Well great I need 60 percent so there you go.
65	9402	Wine	East Asian	RP	Perfect!
65	9403	Wine	East Asian	P1	So then can we decide what temperature do we want at the grocery?
65	9404	Grocery	America	IDN	Well that actually I know is a problem because in breads they do well at a higher temperature.
65	9405	Wine	East Asian	QP	Ok well how much?
65	9406	Grocery	America	IP	"""Well you know 71 72 degrees,"
65	9407	Grocery	America	INN	but I know wines need to be stored chilled so.
65	9408	Grocery	America	SBR	"""And it is also you know a little more expensive to have that extra a/c on in the summer,"
65	9409	Grocery	America	INN	but I know it is a problem with wines.
65	9410	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Yeah but also I mean you have some bakeries after they have baked they should be put in the cold temperatures I think.
65	9411	Grocery	America	SBR	No actually apparently they do a lot better in warmer temperatures. Weve seen in the shop that they go bad more slowly if theyre at higher temperature.
65	9412	Wine	East Asian	PC	Can we just make it like the middle temperature?
65	9413	Grocery	America	INP	Yeah I mean I do know that you need things a little bit cooler
65	9414	Grocery	America	OS	so I would be willing to go down to 69 if that is ok with you?
65	9415	Wine	East Asian	RP	Yeah thats ok with me. Ok that will be good.
65	9416	Grocery	America	MIN	So 69 degrees.
65	9417	Wine	East Asian	P1	Ok so the last thing to go back over opening date.
65	9418	Grocery	America	MIC	I mean I think this is going to be great. Yeah I think this going to be a good relationship so I am very encouraged.
65	9419	Grocery	America	IR	But I do have to say the grand opening date is really really important.
65	9420	Grocery	America	SBR	I mean I am not going to have the employees.
65	9421	Grocery	America	SBR	Were going to be opening and. If we lose one employee I am going to be in serious trouble.
65	9422	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Yeah I can understand that
65	9423	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""but if you put that late like September I will just have no job to do for several months,"
65	9424	Wine	East Asian	SBR	and all the employees will have no payment. So thats a serious problem also.
65	9425	Grocery	America	MIC	Yes I understand.
65	9426	Grocery	America	CS	"""Well I dont know if this is ok according to the rules. It is hard to do cross training but if I were to lose an employee,would it be possible for say you to request that your employees pick up some slack and like they do the cleaning the after hours cleaning and then of course Ill get an employee as quickly as possible"
65	9427	Grocery	America	OS	and then maybe I can push it up to August 1st.
65	9428	Wine	East Asian	QM	August?
65	9429	Grocery	America	OS	August.
65	9430	Wine	East Asian	MIN	I mean I can have some extra.
65	9431	Wine	East Asian	MIN	I dont know.
65	9432	Wine	East Asian	CS	Just after their work hours I can pay them more to help you.
65	9433	Wine	East Asian	IP	But I just want to get in early opening date
65	9434	Wine	East Asian	SBR	because then the employees will be happy; they will get extra payment.
65	9435	Grocery	America	MIC	Thats true.
65	9436	Wine	East Asian	SBR	And my employees are very I think very well trained.
65	9437	Grocery	America	QP	So you think August isnt early enough?
65	9438	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Is it early enough?
65	9439	Wine	East Asian	OS	Can we just do July?
65	9440	Grocery	America	RN	Ugh
65	9441	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Just depends on how much trouble.
65	9442	Grocery	America	SBR	Well if you think about it we are paying more cost on rent than I had considered.
65	9443	Grocery	America	SBR	And I am wondering since we spending more on renovation maybe we should give the extra time to spend the money.
65	9444	Grocery	America	MIN	If you understand what I mean?
65	9445	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Yeah I understand.
65	9446	Grocery	America	SBR	And since I mean the renovation we can spend the money I am willing to spend it
65	9447	Grocery	America	SBR	but I am afraid we are going to get a sloppy job if we move up the opening date so early.
65	9448	Grocery	America	QS	So is your store not going to be in operation at all?
65	9449	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Almost I think because I almost have everything.
65	9450	Wine	East Asian	IP	Because the earlier the best I think May the 1st is actually the time I prefer
65	9451	Wine	East Asian	OS	so I can just do like May
65	9452	Wine	East Asian	OS	but if you want September I think some time in the middle of them should be best for us thats July.
65	9453	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I just dont want to get too late. Thats one month for everything.
65	9454	Grocery	America	QS	Well I mean is your business in operation right now?
65	9455	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yes
65	9456	Grocery	America	SBR	So I mean is it really a big deal if you know youre running right now.
65	9457	Grocery	America	SBR	"""So actually,Im not sure why you want this date so far forward."
65	9458	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Thats some issue of me.
65	9459	Wine	East Asian	IP	I just want the earlier theJust some issue I want to be as early as possible.
65	9460	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Yeah because it already gives me plenty of time for renovation.
65	9461	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I think the time is enough too.
65	9462	Grocery	America	MIN	Ok well.
65	9463	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""I think it will everything will be smooth for you to find the employees,its not that hard."
65	9464	Grocery	America	SBR	Well its employees and its also of course these international products that Im ordering they take a very long time to get here.
65	9465	Grocery	America	SBR	"""But I have to admit thats not quite as important to me because as long as I have some on the shelves,then it will look good."
65	9466	Grocery	America	SBR	But I am worried about the employees.
65	9467	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I mean the employees is the biggest issue for you I mean I can help.
65	9468	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I just dont want to put it so late. September is too late for me.
65	9469	Grocery	America	QP	And August is too late as well?
65	9470	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yeah.
65	9471	Grocery	America	OS	Alright well ok lets go to July 1st
65	9472	Grocery	America	MIN	but I have to admit I am going to be leaning on you for employees during that time.
65	9473	Wine	East Asian	CS	Ok thats no problem and I think my employees will be happy to get the extra payment.
65	9474	Grocery	America	MIC	Yeah I am sure
65	9475	Wine	East Asian	PO	Alright then everything is settled then?
65	9476	Grocery	America	MIN	Yes I think so.
65	9477	Grocery	America	MIC	This is great I am really looking forward to our business together.
65	9478	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Yeah me too.
65	9479	Grocery	America	MIC	Thank you.
65	9480	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Thank you.
66	9481	Grocery	American	MIC	Hi Im Erin.
66	9482	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Hi Im Joyin.
66	9483	Wine	East Asian	P1	"""Okay,lets first talk about the operating hours."
66	9484	Grocery	American	MIN	Okay.
66	9485	Wine	East Asian	QP	What do you think?
66	9486	Grocery	American	SF	"""Well for me because it is a coffee business,"
66	9487	Grocery	American	IP	""","",I was hoping to open it earlier"
66	9488	Grocery	American	SBR	""",because people normally get their coffee early in the morning."
66	9489	Grocery	American	IP	""",""So for me I would prefer,I mean I am willing to 7:30 but generally I would prefer 6:30."
66	9490	Grocery	American	QP	""",,What were you"
66	9491	Wine	East Asian	IP	6:30 would be too early for me
66	9492	Wine	East Asian	SBR	because mine is like wine house.
66	9493	Wine	East Asian	IP	So I would prefer to start a little bit later in the morning but operate a little bit later at night.
66	9494	Grocery	American	OS	So 7:30?
66	9495	Wine	East Asian	RN	7:30?
66	9496	Wine	East Asian	IP	Its too early.
66	9497	Grocery	American	QM	Its too early?
66	9498	Wine	East Asian	OS	Yeah how about 9:30?
66	9499	Grocery	American	IP	But thats so late
66	9499	Grocery	American	SF	because I have a coffee business.
66	9500	Wine	East Asian	SBR	But you know if we open at 7:30 we will close at 7:30 at night.
66	9501	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""So thats too early for me,"
66	9502	Wine	East Asian	SBR	because people usually go to bars and have drinks at night.
66	9503	Grocery	American	PC	Maybe we could do in between 7:30 and 9:30 and open at 8:30.
66	9504	Wine	East Asian	RN	8:30?
66	9505	Wine	East Asian	IP	8:30 at night is too early.
66	9506	Grocery	American	QM	Its too early?
66	9507	Wine	East Asian	QS	Is that strange?
66	9508	Grocery	American	IP	Man 9:30 is too late.
66	9509	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yes but 9:30 is okay for me.
66	9510	Grocery	American	SBR	Yeah but if you think about it everyone gets their morning coffee before they go to work you know so if the business isnt open
66	9511	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Youre coffee shop doesnt only sell coffee.
66	9512	Grocery	American	SBR	It is a big part of my business I think.
66	9513	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I mean people may come to my shop and then go to your shop and get other things other than coffee.
66	9514	Wine	East Asian	MINEG	8:30 is too early
66	9515	Wine	East Asian	SBR	because people usually finish their dinner at 8:30 at night.
66	9516	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Because 9:30,"
66	9517	Wine	East Asian	IP	actually originally I prefer 10:30.
66	9518	Grocery	American	RN	10:30 oh wow.
66	9519	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Yes so I backed down.
66	9520	Grocery	American	PM	"""Oh man,well how about we skip this one and well come back."
66	9521	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok
66	9522	Grocery	American	SF	I sell not only coffee but specialty pastries and a lot of breakfast items.
66	9523	Grocery	American	IP	I would really like to have the store open early.
66	9524	Wine	East Asian	IDN	Mine is the opposite.
66	9525	Grocery	American	MIN	I know I figured it would be that way.
66	9526	Grocery	American	MIN	So
66	9527	Wine	East Asian	P1	So lets move on to renovation cost.
66	9528	Grocery	American	MIN	Yeah alright.
66	9529	Grocery	American	QP	How much would you like to spend?
66	9530	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""30,000"
66	9531	Grocery	American	RN	"""30,000?"
66	9532	Grocery	American	IP	Umm that is a lot.
66	9533	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Because appearance is very important to our customers.
66	9534	Grocery	American	SBR	Well I personally think that the appearance is not that bad. I think it is a nice area and I dont think it really needs that much renovation.
66	9535	Grocery	American	SBR	,I think having employees that are well trained and well balanced would be a better part of the company to spend my money on
66	9536	Grocery	American	IP	"""so I would much rather spend not 30,000. I mean maybe 15,000 or 20,000 even I would be willing to spend 20,000. I mean I personally would only like to spend 10,000."
66	9537	Grocery	American	SBR	,Wine,OK but you know people usually prefer a comfortable and fun place to have drinks. No matter they drink wine or coffee. Its worth spending a lot more on that.
66	9538	Grocery	American	SBR	Because you know well cover the cost if we can attract more customers to come.
66	9539	Grocery	American	PC	"""Yeah,I mean a 20,000 is a good balance in between right. I mean it is a good in between where we both you know."
66	9539	Grocery	American	OS	20,000?
66	9540	Wine	East Asian	RP	"""Ok 20,000."
66	9541	Grocery	American	MIC	"""Ok so well go with 20,000."
66	9542	Grocery	American	QP	Alright how much floor space would you like?
66	9543	Wine	East Asian	IP	I will occupy 40 percent of yours?
66	9544	Grocery	American	QM	Of the whole thing?
66	9545	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah
66	9546	Grocery	American	QM	And Ill keep my 60 percent?
66	9547	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah
66	9548	Grocery	American	RP	Ok thats fine.
66	9549	Wine	East Asian	QP	How about for temperature?
66	9550	Grocery	American	QP	Would you like it colder?
66	9551	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yes
66	9552	Wine	East Asian	SBR	because I need to keep my wine at a lower degree.
66	9553	Grocery	American	SBR	But for the temperature for the wine you could always have like a cooling system for your area
66	9554	Grocery	American	SBR	because my food is very able to spoil. I mean it keeps better in warmer temperatures.
66	9555	Grocery	American	IP	So maybe we could say like 71 degrees.
66	9556	Wine	East Asian	RN	71 degrees?!
66	9557	Wine	East Asian	IP	Its too high
66	9558	Grocery	American	IP	Yeah I mean 73 degrees it what I really like but 71 degrees is ok.
66	9559	Grocery	American	SBR	Wine,No my wine has to be kept 65 otherwise else it will spoil.
66	9560	Grocery	American	SBR	But my food has to be kept at 73
66	9561	Wine	East Asian	OS	How about 69 degrees
66	9562	Grocery	American	RP	69 is fine
66	9563	Grocery	American	MIC	because you know I want to be able to work with you.
66	9564	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Yes me too.
66	9565	Grocery	American	QP	When do you want to open your uh?
66	9566	Wine	East Asian	IP	I want to open as soon as possible
66	9567	Wine	East Asian	SBR	because before our competitor comes I want to grab more business beforehand.
66	9568	Grocery	American	SBE	See for me I need to order supplies and I have a lot of different types of products that I sell.
66	9569	Grocery	American	IP	So I really would prefer a later opening date
66	9570	Grocery	American	SBR	because a lot of my items come from abroad.
66	9571	Grocery	American	SBR	I also think it is really important that we have good customer service and good employees so I would like more time to train them or whatever.
66	9572	Grocery	American	IP	So I think the earliest I would be willing to open is July 1st. I prefer August 1st or even September 1st.
66	9573	Grocery	American	IP	Wine,I prefer May 1st
66	9574	Grocery	American	RN	May 1st?!
66	9575	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Because I have all the wine ready
66	9576	Grocery	American	MIN	I know but
66	9577	Wine	East Asian	SBR	I am ready for business and the sooner you open the better the business will be.
66	9578	Grocery	American	SBR	I know but I dont have nay products so I cant open
66	9579	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok
66	9580	Grocery	American	SBR	Because my products are coming from abroad. Like I umm I have a lot of items from abroad
66	9581	Grocery	American	SBE	and I need time to hire and train people because I offer a wide variety of products and so they need time to learn about them.
66	9582	Grocery	American	OS	So August 1st?
66	9583	Wine	East Asian	OS	July 1st?
66	9584	Grocery	American	MIN	How about
66	9585	Wine	East Asian	PC	That is like the medium.
66	9586	Grocery	American	MIN	How about
66	9587	Wine	East Asian	OS	June 1st?
66	9588	Wine	East Asian	SBR	You know my ideal day is May 1st.
66	9589	Grocery	American	RN	July 1st?
66	9590	Grocery	American	PM	Well lets go back to hours of operation.
66	9591	Grocery	American	MIC	Lets see if we can make a deal.
66	9592	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok
66	9593	Grocery	American	MIN	So lets see.
66	9594	Wine	East Asian	PO	Wait a minute so we agree on July 1st?
66	9595	Wine	East Asian	QM	Not yet?
66	9596	Grocery	American	MIN	Not yet.
66	9597	Grocery	American	MIN	So lets see.
66	9598	Grocery	American	IDN	So youd like to open at 10:30 and Id like to open at 6:30.
66	9599	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Um hum
66	9600	Grocery	American	SBR	I mean but arent there laws that dont let people buy alcohol past 9 oclock anyway?
66	9601	Wine	East Asian	MIN	I umm then how about ok.
66	9602	Wine	East Asian	PP	That on the grand opening date maybe August 1st you want so how about you give some room for me for the operation hours.
66	9603	Grocery	American	QM	So like what 10?
66	9604	Wine	East Asian	OM	Like 9:30.
66	9605	Grocery	American	MIN	How about well do
66	9606	Wine	East Asian	OM	"""So but I can postpone,I can allow you to open in August 1st."
66	9607	Grocery	American	SBR	Yeah um the only problem is over time I would make a lot more business being open earlier.
66	9608	Grocery	American	PC	How about we go to the medium on both since these are both very uh serious issues.
66	9609	Wine	East Asian	PO	We chose all the mediums for all of them.
66	9610	Grocery	American	OM	Well 8:30 and July 1st?
66	9611	Grocery	American	SBR	"""July 1st is a compromise on both sides and 8:30 I guess is early enough for people to,I mean generally people get their coffee at 6:30 but I guess there are a few stragglers who will get their coffee at 8:30."
66	9612	Grocery	American	SBR	And then I mean people will be going out more after and not going to the store. So 8:308:30.
66	9613	Grocery	American	QM	Does that sound reasonable?
66	9614	Wine	East Asian	QM	8:308:30 and then July 1st?
66	9615	Grocery	American	MIN	Yeah.
66	9616	Wine	East Asian	RP	Ok.
66	9617	Grocery	American	MIN	"""So eight thirty eight thirty 20,000 for renovation,60 percent, 69 degrees, and July 1st."
66	9618	Grocery	American	MIC	Ok. Cool.
66	9619	Grocery	American	PO	So are we done.
66	9620	Grocery	American	QM	Were done right?
66	9621	Wine	East Asian	MIC	"""Were done,yeah."
66	9622	Grocery	American	OT	So what do we do?
66	9623	Wine	East Asian	OT	Should we call her?
66	9624	Grocery	American	OT	How long was that?
68	9628	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Hi.,
68	9629	Wine	America	MIC	Hi.,
68	9630	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	So lets talk about it.,
68	9631	Grocery	East Asian	IR	I would just say that the very important thing for me is the opening date.,
68	9632	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So I would prefer September 1st.,
68	9633	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Is that ok for you?,
68	9634	Wine	America	IP	Umm September the 1st is kind of late for me.,
68	9635	Wine	America	PX	"""I could do,well if we could agree on some other things that are important to me I could agree to."","
68	9636	Wine	America	PP	Well I would be happy to agree to August 1st if we say I could have temperature of the store a certain temperature.,
68	9637	Grocery	East Asian	QP	For example what temperature would that?,
68	9638	Wine	America	IP	65 degrees,
68	9639	Wine	America	SBR	because for me I could lose a lot of money if my wine goes bad.,
68	9640	Grocery	East Asian	QM	So you want September 1st and 65 degree?,
68	9641	Wine	America	OM	Umm well I would prefer August 1st and 65 degrees.,
68	9642	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Ummm lets see.,
68	9643	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""I prefer how about 69 degree and you want August 1st right,August 1st and its only 5 degrees well 4 degrees actually yeah."","
68	9644	Wine	America	RN	Ummm no thats a big difference for wine.,
68	9645	Wine	America	IP	67 would be ok I guess.,
68	9646	Wine	America	IR	67 degrees is more important than the date to me.,
68	9647	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Right but my thing is that if the temperature is too low its hard for me to keep my stuff so.,
68	9648	Grocery	East Asian	PC	""" So we need to yeah,we need to find some in between."","
68	9649	Grocery	East Asian	INN	So for you the important thing is temperature.,
68	9650	Grocery	East Asian	OM	How about if I agree to August 1st and 67 degrees can we let the hours be 7:30 am? 7:307:30?,
68	9651	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Is that ok?,
68	9652	Grocery	East Asian	PP	Yeah lets just combine the 3.,
68	9653	Wine	America	MIN	Ummm 7:30.,
68	9654	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Cause you know I just withdraw. I mean I just allowed large temperatures. Its like3 below 67.,
68	9655	Grocery	East Asian	PP	If temperature is so important for you and I would give that up in exchange for opening date and hours of operation.,
68	9656	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah.,
68	9657	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Ok?,
68	9658	Wine	America	MIN	Let me think if.,
68	9659	Wine	America	OM	Im trying to think between 67 and 7:30
68	9659	Wine	America	OM	or say between 69 and 8:30.,
68	9660	Wine	America	SBR	Because I want the store open long enough so that people will be able to buy wine at night.,
68	9661	Wine	America	SBR	But I also want them to be able to buy wine thats not bad.,
68	9662	Grocery	East Asian	SF	Ok so you want..The thing for me is like its grocery store. We need to sell breakfast.,
68	9663	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	""" If we open like 8:30 whos going to buy. Because at that time most people have already gone into office,so I dont know."","
68	9665	Wine	America	MIN	Thats true.,
68	9666	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""So what if we make it this August 1st,65 degree, and 7:30. Is that ok?"","
68	9667	Wine	America	RP	Yeah that would be good.,
68	9668	Grocery	East Asian	P1	Renovation cost and floor space.,
68	9669	Grocery	East Asian	PO	I think that will be done quickly right?,
68	9670	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah.,
68	9671	Grocery	East Asian	QR	Umm ok so which one is important for you?,
68	9672	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Which one do you prefer?,
68	9673	Wine	America	MIN	Well the ideal is,
68	9674	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I think wine floor doesnt really need to occupy so much space right?,
68	9675	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah.,
68	9676	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Wines like small space so.,
68	9677	Wine	America	OM	"""I would be willing to do,say give me 30 percent of the store and 30,000 renovation."","
68	9678	Grocery	East Asian	QP	You want how much renovation cost do you want?,
68	9679	Wine	America	IP	30,
68	9680	Wine	America	SBR	Cause if I am going to get a small part of the store at least I want it to,
68	9681	Grocery	East Asian	OT	I dont know renovation cost is something we need to split or what do you mean.,
68	9682	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Because I dont know whats the total thats the thing I want to know.,
68	9683	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Whats the total cost we should split up?,
68	9684	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Should we ask her? Should we stop and ask her?,
68	9685	Grocery	East Asian	OT	I dont see anything that umm.,
68	9686	Wine	America	OT	I mean this coming out of our money so.,
68	9687	Grocery	East Asian	OT	"""The total probably is 40,000 right?"","
68	9688	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Maybe I guess.,
68	9689	Wine	America	OT	Do we split the,
68	9690	Grocery	East Asian	OT	I dont know whats the total so like we can discuss how to split them.,
68	9691	Grocery	East Asian	QP	So whats your budget? What you want 30 right?,
68	9692	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Wine,30 yeah.,
68	9693	Grocery	East Asian	INN	"""You want 30,000."","
68	9694	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Right I think I should ask her. Should we stop here or?,
68	9695	Grocery	East Asian	INN	You want 30 and you want.,
68	9696	Wine	America	OT	So that would be 15 each.,
68	9697	Grocery	East Asian	OT	Hum?,
68	9698	Wine	America	OT	That 30 would be 15 each or 30 each.,
68	9699	Wine	America	OT	Grocery,We dont have to think about the price it takes we just think the cost is what we should spend. She didnt make this very clear and detailed.,
68	9700	Wine	America	QP	"""So you want 30,000 and 70 percent."","
68	9701	Wine	America	IP	Umm No no I dont want 70 percent. 40 or 30% for the store.,
68	9703	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Oh yeah you want 40 or 30?,
68	9704	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah,
68	9705	Grocery	East Asian	INN	"""Oh ok,Yeah you want 40 percent."","
68	9706	Wine	America	OM	"""I mean if its going to be 40 then I definitely want 30,000 renovation."","
68	9707	Grocery	East Asian	QP	"""Uh huh,if its 30 how much do you want?"","
68	9708	Wine	America	IP	"""Umm actually,30 I would want 30 and 40"","
68	9709	Wine	America	IP	,I wouldnt mind 25.,
68	9710	Wine	America	SBR	Thats ok because then if I have more space but its not as renovated I can make it up in space and just supplying more wine.,
68	9711	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Uhhuh.,
68	9712	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""I wanted to make it 60 percent for myself,which means you cant. You occupy 30 percent and."","
68	9713	Wine	America	QP	Wait you want 60 percent?,
68	9714	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Right I want 60 percent and your going to have 40.,
68	9715	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""Thats what I want and umm I intended to have the renovation cost at 15,000."","
68	9716	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	So I dont know.,
68	9717	Grocery	East Asian	IS	I think floor space is something we are within reach because we are not far away from each other. The thing is renovation cost.,
68	9718	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I wonder because I dont think wine store costs so much. Wine store you dont have to spend too much money.,
68	9719	Wine	America	SBR	Yeah but a lot about wine.,
68	9720	Wine	America	SBR	I mean all about wine is the image of the wine and the image of the store and if it looks shabby then the wine is going to look shabby and no one likes that.,
68	9721	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Well actually sometimes when you look into the antique store you feel like they have history. You dont feel bad with that.,
68	9722	Wine	America	SBR	As long as its not dirty. Dirty and antique are different.,
68	9723	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Right so I dont think we have to spend too much.,
68	9724	Wine	America	SBR	"""I am more concerned with it looking clean,invitable, and like if its not hygienic for your food than its also not."","
68	9725	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Well the thing is I think right your right.,
68	9726	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	Thats how much you are going to spend monthly thats cleaning cost thats not renovation cost.,
68	9727	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	So I am thinking like maybe we can reach the like lower renovation cost. And maybe we are going to clean it more often.,
68	9728	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	So renovation cost its something we can really cut down.,
68	9729	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	So,
68	9730	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah,
68	9731	Grocery	East Asian	OM	"""How about 60 percent how about 20,000 renovation cost?"","
68	9732	Wine	America	RP	Thats fine.,
68	9733	Grocery	East Asian	QM	And Ill take 60 percent floor space ok?,
68	9734	Wine	America	MIN	Ok.,
68	9735	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	We are so quick.,
68	9736	Grocery	East Asian	PO	So we agreed on 5 items.,
68	9737	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	"""Hours of operation 7:307:30,renovation cost 20,000, floor space 60 percent for me 40 percent for you, temperature 65 degrees, grand opening date on August 1st."","
68	9738	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah,
68	9739	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Ok,
68	9740	Wine	America	MIN	Ok.,
68	9741	Grocery	East Asian	PT	"""We are so quick,were done in 10 minutes."","
69	9745	Grocery	American	MIC	"""So,I guess we have to divide up the space."","
69	9746	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Yes.,
69	9752	Grocery	American	IP	9:30 would be too late.,
69	9753	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Since it is in D.C.,most of the work crowd would probably be at work. I was hoping hit them on their way to work."
69	9753	Grocery	American	OS	"So I was thinking more along the lines of 7:30."","
69	9754	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""7:30 but if the store closes at 7:30people go to Dupont circle after work and maybe they have dinner there and then,I guess a lot of people come to the liquor store and it is wine and stuff."","
69	9755	Wine	East Asian	IP	So I prefer to close the store at 8:30.,
69	9756	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Because 6:30 is too early.,
69	9757	Grocery	American	IP	Right and 10:30 is too late for me.,
69	9758	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Yeah,okay."","
69	9759	Wine	East Asian	OS	How about 8:30?,
69	9760	Grocery	American	MIC	That would be a possibility.,
69	9761	Grocery	American	PM	We can come back to that if that is okay.,
69	9762	Grocery	American	QR	"""Okay,what is something else that is very important to you?"","
69	9763	Wine	East Asian	IR	Umm renovation costs.,
69	9764	Grocery	American	MIN	OK,
69	9765	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Because umm my wine store is liquor store is targeting to high class people and our wine are very special expensive wines so both interior and exterior of the store is so important for us,
69	9766	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""so I like to spend as much as money we can for renovation. So 3,30,000 dollars is my first choice."","
69	9767	Grocery	American	RN	"""Of course,I am on the opposite end of the spectrum and dont think I can spend that much on renovation cost."","
69	9768	Grocery	American	INN	But I do understand your point wanting to do better advertising and draw more customers in. That would also benefit me.,
69	9769	Grocery	American	PP	"""So perhaps we can make a deal so that you can have maybe not 30,000 in renovation cost but higher renovation cost and I could have more floor space or more say on a grand opening date."","
69	9770	Wine	East Asian	QP	Umm when?,
69	9771	Grocery	American	PP	If I could have more floor space or a different grand opening date. Have a little bit more say in that area. I would definitely enable you to have more say in renovation cost and temperature per say.,
69	9772	Wine	East Asian	IR	Ok actually temperature and renovation cost are important to us.,
69	9773	Wine	East Asian	QP	So how much floor space would you like to have?,
69	9774	Grocery	American	IP	Ideally I would like 60 percent.,
69	9775	Wine	East Asian	RP	Oh that is great because we would like 40 percent.,
69	9776	Grocery	American	MIC	"""Oh that would work out perfectly,then."","
69	9777	Wine	East Asian	QP	And I how about the grand opening date,
69	9778	Grocery	American	IP	I would prefer later.,
69	9779	Grocery	American	SBR	That would also allow the renovation to take a little longer and us to make it look better
69	9779	Grocery	American	IP	so I was leaning towards August or September.,
69	9780	Grocery	American	QM	Wine,Oh really?,
69	9781	Grocery	American	MIN	Yeah,
69	9782	Wine	East Asian	SBR	Actually we already have all the liquor and wines we are going to sell in the store.,
69	9783	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""Actually the earlier the better for us,"","
69	9784	Wine	East Asian	QP	but how about temperature?,
69	9785	Grocery	American	SBR	"""For the grocery store mostly since it is a bakery,temperature doesnt matter to us that much."","
69	9786	Grocery	American	IP	We would prefer a higher temperature to keep energy costs down. But obviously since you are a wine store.,
69	9787	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yeah its cooler like more temperature is better for us.,
69	9788	Grocery	American	SBR	Perhaps if we open a little later temperature wouldnt have to be as cool to begin with saving a/c cost.,
69	9789	Grocery	American	OS	But I would be willing to open in July.,
69	9790	Grocery	American	IB	I dont think I could open before July.,
69	9791	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok July 1st is,
69	9792	Grocery	American	MIN	Ok,
69	9793	Wine	East Asian	RP	Ok yes.,
69	9794	Wine	East Asian	IP	So for us the cooler is the better,
69	9795	Grocery	American	MIN	Of course,
69	9796	Wine	East Asian	OS	Yeah so our first choice is 65 but how do you think about it?,
69	9798	Wine	East Asian	OS	How about 67?,
69	9799	Grocery	American	OS	I would at least go to 69.,
69	9800	Wine	East Asian	PP	I may go to 67 depending on how much we spend on renovation cost.,
69	9801	Grocery	American	MIN	Ok,
69	9802	Wine	East Asian	OM	"""I would be willing to spend 20,000 in renovation cost and give you 67 degree temperature."","
69	9803	Wine	East Asian	OM	"""Otherwise I would prefer to do 65 degree and then bump the renovation cost to 25,000."","
69	9804	Grocery	American	MIC	Actually that is better for us.,
69	9805	Grocery	American	RP	""" So 25,000 renovation cost and 69 degrees."","
69	9806	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yes.,
69	9807	Grocery	American	PO	So I guess we have decided on everything right?,
69	9808	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yes,
69	9809	Grocery	American	MIN	So we said 8:30,
69	9810	Wine	East Asian	MIN	8:30,
69	9811	Grocery	American	MIN	"""And 25,000"","
69	9812	Wine	East Asian	MIN	25 and,
69	9813	Grocery	American	MIN	60 percent of the space,
69	9814	Wine	East Asian	MIN	40 percent for me and,
69	9815	Grocery	American	MIN	69 degrees and open July 1st.,
69	9816	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok,
70	9817	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Hi,
70	9818	Wine	America	MIC	Hey.,
70	9819	Wine	America	P1	Uhh so we have to agree on hours of operation.,
70	9820	Wine	America	QP	And what do you want?,
70	9821	Grocery	East Asian	SF	Umm for my grocery shop we sell the breakfast.,
70	9822	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""So as early as possible for me,like, the earlier the better."","
70	9823	Wine	America	IP	"""Right,well since I am liquor store we open later"","
70	9824	Wine	America	SBR	because people usually buy like liquor later in the day and they really dont go out early to get it.,
70	9825	Wine	America	IP	""" So,like my ideal hours would be 10:30 to 10:30."","
70	9826	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Yeah my ideal hours would be 6:30 to like morning to 6:30..,
70	9827	Wine	America	MIN	Um hum.,
70	9828	Grocery	East Asian	PC	So Im thinking probably we can umm compromise to open either 8:30,
70	9829	Grocery	East Asian	IP	or I was thinking 7:30 would be good for me,
70	9830	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	because for your liquor store people can get the like wine after you get out of work. And 7:30 will be kind of reasonable for them toWell most of the people get off of work around 5:30 or sixish so 7:30 will be reasonable for them to get the wine after they get off work,
70	9831	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	,and it will be also workable for me like 7:30 is the time you go to work . So it will be easy for me to sell breakfast and so,
70	9832	Grocery	East Asian	RP	Wine,Umm we can go with 8:30,
70	9833	Grocery	East Asian	PC	because it will sort of be in the middle for both of us.,
70	9834	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Because like most people go to work at like nine. So they go to breakfast at like 8:30 or stop by and then it wouldnt be open like it wouldnt close too early for people that want to buy liquor.,
70	9835	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Grocery,Umm ok I guess that makes sense we can take probably 8:30 until 8:30 at night.,
70	9836	Wine	America	MIN	Okay.,
70	9837	Wine	America	P1	Alright so renovation costs.,
70	9838	Wine	America	IP	"""I want to spend a lot of money like 30,000 dollars"
70	9838	Wine	America	SBR	"because thats like you know really important for the people to think it looks nice."","
70	9839	Wine	America	SBR	Like you wouldnt want to shop somewhere where you didnt think it looked nice.,
70	9840	Wine	America	QP	So what do you think?,
70	9841	Grocery	East Asian	IP	"""I am more preferring 10,000 dollars"","
70	9842	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	since my grocery shopping rather spend most of the money on the stuff and,
70	9843	Wine	America	MIN	Oh no just go ahead.,
70	9844	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	I would rather spend most of the money on like training the employees like the newcomer and stuff.,
70	9845	Grocery	East Asian	MIC	Well I do agree with your point that the shop has to look nice and stuff,
70	9846	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	but I am also worried about the quality of our employees and like the people that work there like the service and stuff.,
70	9847	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So I would rather spend more money on that one instead of spending how much money on like trying to make it look good and actually not have really bad service.,
70	9848	Wine	America	SBR	Yeah well we need to look ready for business.,
70	9849	Wine	America	PM	Well lets look at the rest of them too to see.
70	9849	Wine	America	QR	Whats the most important thing to you?,
70	9850	Wine	America	QP	What do you want the temperature to be?,
70	9851	Wine	America	QP	And the floor space?,
70	9852	Wine	America	MIN	Whats the best for you for those?,
70	9853	Grocery	East Asian	QM	Floor space?,
70	9854	Wine	America	MIN	Um hum.,
70	9855	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I was thinking like 60 percent of it.,
70	9856	Wine	America	QM	You want 60 percent?,
70	9857	Wine	America	RP	Umm ok I want like 40 percent so we could just do that.,
70	9858	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah ok so Ill take 60 percent of the space.,
70	9859	Wine	America	MIN	Ill take 40.,
70	9860	Wine	America	QP	What do you think for temperature?,
70	9861	Wine	America	IP	I need it to be sort of cold for my liquor.,
70	9862	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I need it to be as hot as possible.,
70	9863	Wine	America	IR	Thats pretty important to me,
70	9864	Wine	America	PP	so if I went with 67 degrees maybe we could spend less on the renovation costs cause that is better for you.,
70	9865	Grocery	East Asian	QP	When is the best grand opening date for you?,
70	9866	Wine	America	IP	The best for me would be May 1st,
70	9867	Wine	America	SBR	because I would like to start you know selling things as soon as possible.,
70	9868	Wine	America	SBR	And that gives us enough time to get everything done that we need to.,
70	9869	Grocery	East Asian	IP	I think May 1st might be a little bit too fast,
70	9870	Grocery	East Asian	SBR	because I have to order a lot of the food and like a lot of grocery stuff.,
70	9871	Grocery	East Asian	IP	So I was thinking the later the better for me so like September 1st.,
70	9872	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Wine,Ok soLets see I agreed upon,
70	9873	Grocery	East Asian	PP	So Im thinking if we can open late I can agree with you on the temperature.,
70	9874	Wine	America	MIN	Okay.,
70	9875	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	So,
70	9876	Wine	America	MIN	So if we like if we open on July 1st or,
70	9877	Grocery	East Asian	IP	Im thinking about August or September,
70	9878	Grocery	East Asian	OM	Wine,Alright if we open August 1st then can we keep it at 67 degrees?,
70	9879	Grocery	East Asian	QP	Umm how about the renovation?,
70	9880	Wine	America	PC	"""Umm we could meet in the middle. We could meet at 20,000"","
70	9882	Wine	America	SBR	because umm I think that will be fair.,

70	9885	Wine	America	MIC	It will still look nice but it wont we wont spend too much money so then you can use it for your groceries.,

72	9998	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Yeah.
72	9999	Grocery	American	PO	I guess well just let me know whats most valuable to you in terms of these different issues.
72	10000	Wine	East Asian	PO	I go first?
72	10001	Wine	East Asian	P1	First is about hours of operation.
72	10002	Wine	East Asian	OS	How about from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.?
72	10003	Grocery	American	SBR	"""Well the issue here with the hours of operation is that my,you know, my shop has breakfast and we sell coffee and baked bread and so you know we wanted to catch the crowd thats coming into work before 7."
72	10004	Grocery	American	IDN	So we actually perfer the opposite
72	10005	Grocery	American	SBR	"""and I was thinking that might even be,you know, well I guess either time seems that it would benefit you because I have a feeling that most people would purchase items on their way back from work.  So, probably around 5 o clock which means after that, like an hour and a half before they get home."
72	10006	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Oh 5 oclock? In the morning.
72	10007	Grocery	American	MIN	No no.
72	10008	Grocery	American	MIN	5 oclock in the afternoon.
72	10009	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Oh yeah.
72	10010	Grocery	American	SBR	"""When works done I figure thats when most people will be doing their shopping. So,you know, if you needed the alchohol for dinner you would probably still be getting it before 6:30."
72	10011	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
72	10012	Grocery	American	PM	Lets come back to that lets just go to the other ones just so that we can get an understanding of what you want.
72	10013	Wine	East Asian	P1	"""Alright,the next renovation cost."
72	10014	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
72	10015	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""I think you know,good working on building will attract many customers"
72	10016	Wine	East Asian	IP	so I think we should we should spend much money.  So yeah.  I suggest like well like three and thirty thousand dollars.
72	10017	Grocery	American	MIC	"""Alright,well, you know, I can understand that point of view but being that the renovations,"
72	10018	Grocery	American	IP	I think that we would be fine with just a little bit
72	10018	Grocery	American	SBR	and I would rather spend that extra money on something like training employees.
72	10019	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ah yeah.
72	10020	Grocery	American	IR	So thats like important to me too.
72	10021	Grocery	American	PO	But lets just lets just keep going through these I think its easier to figure out whats best.
72	10022	Grocery	American	QP	So how bout the floor space? Whats your best for you there?
72	10023	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah
72	10024	Wine	East Asian	IP	my request is 40 percent for me.
72	10025	Grocery	American	MIC	Alright well.
72	10026	Grocery	American	QP	You would like 40%?
72	10027	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yeah I would like 40%.
72	10028	Grocery	American	IP	Alright well my request would be for 60%.
72	10029	Grocery	American	MIN	I dont quite understand that
72	10030	Grocery	American	QM	"""I guess that would,that would be fine for both of us, right?"
72	10031	Wine	East Asian	MIN	"""Um,yeah."
72	10032	Grocery	American	MIN	I dont know.
72	10033	Grocery	American	RP	"""Yeah,so I mean, if your interested in 40%, 60% would work best for me. So that seems like an agreeable place right there."
72	10034	Wine	East Asian	QM	So is it settled?
72	10035	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Is it floor space 40% for me
72	10036	Grocery	American	MIN	40% for you and 60% for me.
72	10037	Grocery	American	MIN	Alright.
72	10038	Grocery	American	P1	And for the temperature.
72	10039	Grocery	American	MIN	You know we got the one space so.
72	10040	Grocery	American	IP	A higher temperature would be more beneficial to us
72	10041	Grocery	American	SBR	because you think preserved well and it helps us keep down on air conditioning costs.
72	10042	Wine	East Asian	SBR	We have many wines you know
72	10043	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""so yeah I prefer...  Id like,like below 70."
72	10044	Grocery	American	QM	Below 70 %?
72	10045	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Below 70 degrees
72	10046	Grocery	American	MIN	70 degrees yeah.
72	10047	Grocery	American	MIN	Ok.
72	10048	Grocery	American	MIN	So alright so you would prefer that.
72	10049	Grocery	American	QP	And how bout the opening date?
72	10050	Wine	East Asian	MIN	The opening date.
72	10051	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""The,the earlier opening would enable, enable us to make us money money much money."
72	10052	Wine	East Asian	IP	So Id prefer earlier opening.
72	10053	Grocery	American	MIN	Alright well um.
72	10054	Grocery	American	SBE	Yeah here I would like to have more time for training
72	10055	Grocery	American	IP	so actually the later the better for me
72	10056	Grocery	American	SBR	Yeah also I got to order some special items that are going to take a while to get here so it would be pointless for me to open too early then I wouldnt have anything to sell.
72	10057	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah yeah.
72	10058	Grocery	American	PO	Alright well lets just look over these options.
72	10059	Grocery	American	QR	"""Whats,how do you, whats your different preference the different categories.  Like what cate can you rank those for me?  Like, which of those is most important for you?"
72	10060	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Um yeah.
72	10061	Wine	East Asian	IR	The renovation cost are the most important for for me
72	10062	Grocery	American	PO	Okay and how bout can you just go straight through?
72	10063	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Oh yeah.
72	10064	Wine	East Asian	IR	The second one is hours of operation and the next is temperature and the last grand opening date.
72	10065	Grocery	American	PO	So yeah but look the floor oh floor space we already did that.
72	10066	Grocery	American	OM	Ok well if you would agree with me having the opening date at the latest point then I would be willing to give you the you know full amount for the renovation cost
72	10067	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Oh it sounds it sounds good.
72	10068	Grocery	American	QM	Do you agree with that?
72	10069	Grocery	American	MIC	Alright cause then I wouldnt mind throwin the extra money for the last one if we opened early
72	10070	Grocery	American	MIC	and that would also give you the improvements you need.
72	10071	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Ok so renovation cost is thirty thousand and grand opening september 1st.
72	10072	Wine	East Asian	RP	"""Oh yeah,alright."
72	10073	Grocery	American	IP	And lets seewell as for the temperature I would like to set it set it high
72	10074	Grocery	American	SBR	and maybe I think that because I have 60% of the floor space that means that I would be paying a larger percentage of the rent so I would be paying a larger percentage for the heating and air conditioning
72	10075	Grocery	American	OS	so would you be open to possibly doing the temperature at 71 degrees?
72	10078	Grocery	American	QP	Well how do you feel about the hours of operation.
72	10079	Grocery	American	PP	Maybe would could make an arrangement there.
72	10080	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Oh yeah
72	10081	Grocery	American	MIN	If you
72	10082	Grocery	American	PC	"""It,it seems like the midway point for us would be 8:30 to 8:30"
72	10083	Grocery	American	OM	so maybe if I was willing to go down to 69 degrees youd would be willing to let me open the shop at 7:30 hours of operation.
72	10084	Wine	East Asian	QM	 7:30?
72	10085	Wine	East Asian	QM	Sorry could you  could you explain
72	10086	Grocery	American	IDN	"""What Im saying was ifright now Im sayin right now you want the hours of operation to be 8:30 to 8:30,I would like it to be 7:30 to 7:30."
72	10087	Grocery	American	IDN	Right now its the same for the temperature where you would like it to be 69 degrees and I would like it to be 71.
72	10088	Grocery	American	MIN	So
72	10089	Wine	East Asian	MINEG	No no.
72	10090	Wine	East Asian	IP	"""I want,I want hours of operation the later opening is, the later opening is is the better or if you agree with that Id like to open at 10:30."
72	10091	Grocery	American	MIN	Yeah.
72	10092	Grocery	American	RN	"""Theres no way I would do it before,or after 9, for sure."
72	10093	Grocery	American	SBR	"""So I definitely cant do those cause thats when most people start work,right?"
72	10093	Grocery	American	MIN	And the,
72	10094	Grocery	American	IR	"""what Im saying is then on the options left,I would be more willing to give up some temperature rather than give up the hours of operation"
72	10095	Grocery	American	SBR	because I wont mind paying a little more for the heating cost or the air conditioning cost if were able to make more money by having better hours.
72	10096	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
72	10097	Grocery	American	QP	It seems like thered be no way youd be willing to do the temperature above 70 degrees right?
72	10098	Wine	East Asian	IP	Yeah.
72	10099	Grocery	American	PO	So we have to reach an agreement on these remaining three options in each category.
72	10100	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah thats right.
72	10101	Grocery	American	IP	And what I was saying is that since I do have more floor space I would prefer to have a higher temperature
72	10102	Grocery	American	SBR	"""to,to keep the costs down since I would be paying more"
72	10103	Grocery	American	PC	but I would also be willing to be more lenient on the temperature since I would able to make more money off of having better hours.
72	10104	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
72	10105	Grocery	American	PP	So so I would propose 7:30 to 7:30 on the hours of operation if I could be more lenient on the temperature.
72	10106	Grocery	American	QP	"""Does it matter wether its lower than,like, is 67 better for you than 69 or does it make a difference?"
72	10109	Grocery	American	QM	So you have the same issue?
72	10110	Wine	East Asian	OM	"""Yeah like yeah Id prefer if I if we have like 71 degrees,I want to open the shop at 9:30 a.m"
72	10111	Grocery	American	RN	Well theres no way that Id be able
72	10112	Wine	East Asian	SBR	"""But if if you if you accept 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. then you can open the,open your shop longer in night, night, at night."
72	10113	Grocery	American	MIC	Yeah I think I see where your coming from
72	10114	Grocery	American	SBR	but the fact is that not that many people are gonna want coffee at night; the interest is going to be in the morning.
72	10115	Grocery	American	IDN	We have the opposite agreement. Youd like it to be lower and Id like it to be higher.
72	10116	Wine	East Asian	OS	So how bout 8:30 to 8:30?
72	10117	Grocery	American	QP	And what were you thinking for temperature?
72	10118	Wine	East Asian	IP	71 71 degrees.
72	10119	Grocery	American	OM	Youd leave it at 71 if I could have the hours of operation at 8:30?
72	10120	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
72	10121	Grocery	American	MIC	Um Alright Alright Id be Id be willing to do that I think.
72	10122	Grocery	American	QM	So youre saying the temperature is 71 degrees and the hours of operation are 8:30.
72	10123	Wine	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.
72	10124	Grocery	American	RP	Alright I would Id agree to that.
72	10125	Wine	East Asian	MIC	Oh thank you so much.
72	10126	Grocery	American	MIC	Yeah well im glad we could come to an agreement on this.
72	10127	Grocery	American	MIN	""" So let me just go over this so we have the 8:30 to 8:30 for hours of operation,renovation costs are 30 thousand, floor space is 60% for me and 40 for you, temperature is going to be at 71 degrees, and the grand opening date will be at Sept. 1st."

75	10354	Wine	America	MIN	Yeah so obvioulsy theres going to be some issues here and I guess we should ask which ones would maximize our profit if we are going to be operating in Dupont and stuff.

75	10369	Wine	America	SBR	Yeah but think about how good it looks sometimes like comparing certain places gourmet to Shoppers or something like Costco.

75	10371	Grocery	East Asian	MIN	Yeah.,

75	10376	Wine	America	PP	Maybe we could do a trade off with something else.  Like jumping ahead a bit for floor space.  Yeah it might affect how we start with the distribution of that.,
