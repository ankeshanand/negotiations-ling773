2,22,Wine,Yeah. So I think the the later time is better for me.,IP
2,23,Wine,I?m not sure whether we can negotiate about this and reach a time and schedule that?that would be good for both of us.,PC
2,24,Grocery,"Yeah,I know that, I?ve got a little bit of give there but not a whole lot.",PC

2,33,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN

2,36,Wine,"And also in,in at night, when people go out and drink wine, out buying  alcohol they can also stop by your grocery store and buy something.",SBR
2,37,Wine,"I believe,I don?t think like, everything after 8:30 means all business stop.",SBR
2,38,Wine,"I,I, I, I don?t think so.",MIN
2,39,Wine,Yeah.,MIN
2,40,Grocery,Well it?s?we got a peak in the morning.,SBR

2,50,Wine,Right.,MIN
2,51,Wine,"But,things are not like any time after, anything other then that time you where have no business, it?s not like that.",MIN
2,52,Wine,"So,well I think we can negotiate something inbetween that both of us can?although not reach our peak time but still get some work above the level of business.   ",PC
2,53,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN
2,54,Grocery,"Yeah,Maybe we should set that one aside for, for, a little while and?",PM

2,61,Wine,"Ok,Ok, Ok.",MIN
2,62,Grocery,What are you thinking about floor space?,QP

2,65,Grocery,40% percent?,QM
2,66,Wine,Yeah.,MIN
2,67,Wine,It will give me enough space to put my stock while you have to do the rest of the store for groceries.,SBR
2,68,Wine,What about you?,QP
2,69,Grocery,"Um,Actually?so 40% for you?",QM
2,70,Wine,40% is ideal?but..is ideal.,IP

2,72,Wine,Oh really?,QM
2,73,Grocery,So that?s perfect.,MIC
2,74,Wine,That?s good.,MIC
2,75,Wine,So then we?re set on this.,MIN
2,76,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN
2,77,Grocery,Well good cause that seems like a nice balance.,MIC
2,78,Grocery,"You know,Your wine will, wine will, draw people in, its flashy and?Good.",MIC
2,79,Wine,What?s next on the list.,P1
2,80,Grocery,How about temperature?,P1
2,81,Wine,Temperature?,QM
2,82,Wine,"Since im storing alcohol,so the lower temperature is better, / it?s for a storage thing.",IP/ SBR
2,83,Wine,I?m not sure about you?,QP
2,84,Grocery,"For me,it?s um, most of my things are pretty shelf tabled,/ so they?the less air coniditioning I have to pay for the better.",SBR/ IP
2,85,Grocery,So?its good?to?the warmer the better?,IP
2,86,Wine,"But,It?s not, so there is no harm to your groceries with the low temperature.",SBR
2,87,Wine,Right?,QS
2,88,Grocery,"No,No there is no harm.",MIN
2,89,Wine,So that?s only the financial thing.,MIN
2,90,Grocery,Yes it?s just a finacial thing.,MIN
2,91,Wine,There is no interest in quality.,MIN
2,92,Wine,So I think we can negotiate a little bit more about this.,PO
2,93,Wine,This is not a very key issue about this.,MIN
2,94,Wine,"I think the quality then the price that?s always the very,most important.",MIN
2,95,Wine,So let?s talk about other things and come back to that.,PM
2,96,Grocery,"Grand opening day,how are you feeling about that?",QP
2,97,Wine,"Well,since I?m ready for business.",SBR
2,98,Wine,"So,I just want after a couple I want to start business.",IP
2,99,Wine,What about you?,QP
2,100,Grocery,"Well,we, since we really pride ourselves on service. We really want a lot of time to be able to set up,",SBR
2,101,Grocery,"to,to, hire people,",SBR
2,102,Grocery,select the right customer service orientated people and train them really well.,SBR
2,103,Grocery,So we really are hoping for September 1.  ,IP
2,104,Wine,Oh my god.,RN
2,105,Grocery,I know.,MIN
2,106,Wine,That?s really late.,RN
2,107,Grocery,"And I?m,And I?m sure you, you wanna get in there and start.",IN-N
2,108,Wine,"Yeah,You know It?s almost half a year past till September 1rst.",SBR
2,109,Grocery,"Yes,It?s a while I know.",IN-N
2,110,Wine,"Actually,well I think, do you think you really need, is that necessary for you to like to train, to spend that much amount of money to do all this thing.",QS
2,111,Grocery,"Well,its just that we really want a quality operation.",SBR
2,112,Grocery,And I feel like if we get off on the wrong foot.,SBR
2,113,Grocery,You know you start and?,MIN
2,114,Wine,But your not worried about losing business during this whole half-a-year?,QM
2,115,Grocery,"No that?s not really,not a concern.",SBR
2,116,Grocery,Because we got our other shop running right now. And so we?ll have to do a transition over.,SBR
2,117,Grocery,"So its,its, September 1, is really ideal.",IP
2,118,Wine,Okay?okay?you have to?you won?t do any harm. If you have lots of other stores is there anyelse.,SBR
2,119,Wine,"You can just copy those systems already and use any innovation you want,you want train this new store to have something new?",SBR
2,120,Wine,"If you just want to keep your business,why didn?t you pick to copy the old system.",SBR
2,121,Grocery,"Well actually,were going, were going to bring the whole operation over.",SBR
2,122,Grocery,"But,for whatever reason we can?t bring our employees.",SBR
2,123,Grocery,So we really need to hire new employees and train them.,SBR
2,124,Grocery,I think because the commute is going to be too difficult.,SBR
2,125,Grocery,"So we?ll have to,the people, we?ll have to hire new people at this location.",SBR
2,126,Wine,"So?what do you think if you,took some of the, part of your employees, to the new place and to train.",SBR
2,127,Wine,"Well you can have them train in the first very beginning and then you have some old people with the new people,that will be, that will be very helpful.",SBR
2,128,Wine,And that will be?,MIN
2,129,Grocery,Maybe.,MIN
2,130,Grocery," We might be able to,we might be able to negotiate a little bit.",PC
2,131,Grocery,Just?,MIN
2,132,Wine,"Yeah. Because I think the later we start,the less business we have?",SBR
2,133,Wine,"So we were thinking,Yeah I know your, your, worrying about the quality of your service but you also should consider your business.",SBR
2,134,Wine,"Half a year,it?s, it?s, it?s, a lot.",SBR
2,135,Grocery,So sounds like that?s kind of a sticking point for us now too.,ID-N
2,136,Grocery,What about renovation costs?,QP
2,137,Wine,Renovation costs?,QM
2,138,Wine,"Because this is an alcohol store,so I really don?t care about how much I?m going to pay, I just want the best looking of the stores.",SBR
2,139,Wine,So the much I pay the more I feel better.,SBR
2,140,Wine,"We?re going to pay all,so I think 30,000, 30,000 dollars is great.",IP
2,141,Grocery,"So were,I think the new place already looks pretty good, we?re pretty happy with how it is.",SBR
2,142,Grocery,"So,were, you know, were trying to keep costs low?you know as much as possible.",SBR
2,143,Grocery,"So we were,we were, shooting for 10,000 dollars.",IP
2,144,Wine,"10,000 dollars.",MIN
2,145,Wine,Do you think that if your store like appears decent outside the present it will be more attractive to customers and they will be more willing to go into it and buy things.,SBR
2,146,Grocery,I think so.,MIN
2,147,Grocery,"But,also like I said, I am pretty happy with the condition.",SBR
2,148,Grocery,I feel like it looks pretty good already.,SBR
2,149,Grocery,And I am happy with how it looks now. ,SBR
2,150,Wine,Okay?So?,MIN
2,151,Grocery,"Yeah,that?s an area we can negotiate on,",MIN
2,152,Grocery,I think that if you could give some on maybe the hours or grand opening date. I think that we could give some on the renovation.,PP
2,153,Wine,"Yeah,The thing that I do to want to insist is the temperature because this would have no harm to your product quality and is very important to the product, to the quality of my product.",SBR
2,154,Wine,So I do really want to insist on this item.,IR
2,155,Wine," If you could give up other things that those,then I will really appreciate. Then I can give up the, my renovation thing.",PP
2,156,Grocery,"Well,I can give some on the temperature but, the, I could also give some on the renonvation.",PP
2,157,Grocery,"The hours are going to more long lasting and I,you know, and that is more important to me, and the grand opening date is more important to me.",IR
2,158,Grocery,But?the temperature we can work with you on that and the renovation cost.,PP
2,159,Grocery,Do you think you could?do you think you could go 8:30 on hours of operation? 8:30-8:30?,OS
2,160,Grocery,I think that 8:30 is the lastest we can really start.,IB
2,161,Grocery,Because?,MIN
2,162,Wine,So I we can start with the easiest one?s first and leave the hard for last.,PO
2,163,Wine," So I think temperature is maybe the easiest one?s first,we?ll solve this problem soon.",PO
2,164,Wine,So temperature and the renovation?,MIN
2,165,Grocery,So if we give the?,MIN
2,166,Grocery,"grand opening and hours are very important to you,",IN-N
2,167,Grocery,then we might want to make sure that we?I don?t want to leave two tough issues for last.,PO
2,168,Wine,Okay?Okay,MIN
2,169,Grocery,"You know,we?re going to be working with each other for a long time.",MU
2,170,Grocery," And I want to make sure we?re both happy with,I think, what we come out with.",MIC
2,171,Grocery,You don?t want to start off on the wrong foot here.,MIN
2,172,Wine,That?s right.,MIC
2,173,Wine,And?,MIN
2,174,Grocery," I think,let?s see?.for renovation?what do you think about?25,000 thousand?",OS
2,175,Wine,"Well,I think it?s, I can accept this.",RP
2,176,Wine," 25,000 is a lot of money.  ",SBR
2,177,Grocery,"Let?s see what we think,hold that?And",MIN
2,178,Wine,"So could you like,give me the 25 thousand here,  And the 65.",OM
2,179,Grocery,"If I could get the grand opening date Septermber 1rst,I would be happy to go to 65 degrees.",OM
2,180,Wine,"Well,Septermber 1st is definitely not going to happen.",RN
2,181,Grocery,"What do you,what do you think is the most you can?the latest you can go?",QP
2,182,Wine,"The latest for me I think is,July, July 1rst.",IP
2,183,Wine,"Know what?I?m thinking in the summertime people tend to go out more and to do more outdoor activities. So they might want to do,they will have more time standing outside of their home like, doing grocieres, buying shopping, going shopping and getting alcohol and whatever.",SBR
2,184,Wine,"So I think that if it?s near September,were going to winter, they will be only less likely to go out to have outdoor activities and more likely to spend time at their homes.",SBR
2,185,Wine,So I think that?in that case? keeping business in the summertime is an important issue.,SBR
2,186,Wine,"Although you say your training stuff is more important,but I do think that keeping business in the summer,  business is better than business in the winter.",SBR
2,187,Grocery,"Let?s hold that as a possibility,the delay.",PM
2,188,Grocery," And hold the 25,000 dollars as a possibility for the renovation costs.",PM
2,189,Grocery," I mean were both happy with the floor space so that?s done,so that?s done..",PO
2,190,Wine,Great.,MIN
2,191,Wine,That?s done.,MIN
2,192,Grocery,Uh?The hours of operations.,P1
2,193,Grocery,"To?If we go past 8:30,I think were just going to miss all the breakfast, you know all the people, going into work grabbing a muffin and coffee. I think if we go past that it?s going to?uh?",SBR
2,194,Wine,"But I think that if it?s earlier then 8:30,then no business will happen for the ?alcohol?",SBR
2,195,Grocery,"I mean ,it?s a, it?s a fairly residential neighborhood.",SBR
2,196,Grocery," It?s,it?s not going to be a late night operation, I don?t think.",SBR
2,197,Grocery,"I think 8:00,8:30 is pretty good.",OS
2,198,Grocery,Especially when you think about winter time people are not going to be out and about that late.,SBR
2,199,Grocery,"And for a grocerystore/wine shop,it seems to me that 8:30 is pretty, pretty  reasonable.",SBR
2,200,Grocery,People are still going to know that it?s there.,SBR
2,201,Grocery,"Anything that they want to buy to make dinner that night they can,they?ll definitely be there before 8:30 and even after dinner they can still buy it.",SBR
2,202,Wine,"So you want to give me the 65 degrees and I ,I think I can give you the 8:30 schedule. Is that okay with you?",OM
2,203,Grocery,The 8:30?,QM
2,204,Wine,Yeah.,MIN
2,205,Wine,The temperature thing.,MIN
2,206,Grocery,"Yeah,I think I could do that.",RP
2,207,Grocery," Okay,let?s see.",MIN
2,208,Wine,Then the only thing left?is?the renovation and grand opening?,PO
2,209,Grocery,Right?,MIN
2,210,Wine,"Well,Actually, okay?",MIN
2,211,Grocery,"Do you think,um let?s see, do you think if we for the renovation, I could even maybe go 30 if you could see your way to August 1st opening. ",OM
2,212,Wine,"Okay,Okay.",RP
2,213,Grocery,Let me take a look at it all again.,MIN
2,214,Wine,"Our operation is from 8:30 to 8:30 and our renovation costs is 30,000,floor space is 40% and?",MIN
2,215,Grocery,60% for me.,MIN
2,216,Wine,And temperature is 65 degrees. And grand opening date is August 1rst.,MIN
2,217,Wine,Okay then were set.,MIN
2,218,Grocery,"I mean,I am a little hesistant because I really like September 1rst.",IP
2,219,Wine,Oh yeah?,QM
2,220,Wine,"That?s only one month and you can have your own staff to train,to train,  your new staff.",SBR
2,221,Wine,"And most of the time I think,without actually doing with certain people, you can not really grasp more skills.",SBR
2,222,Wine,And theres a different from real training and real actually doing the things.,SBR
2,223,Wine,"So,I think that?s its wiser for you to just keep that month for that real train on duty.",SBR
2,224,Wine,They can learn something from that.,SBR
2,225,Wine,"It?s not my issue?Actually,I was worrying about hours of operation.",P1
2,226,Wine,I know that really it?s not open that late and people tend to use alcohol at late at 9.,SBR
2,227,Wine,I was kind of wondering about that.,MIN
2,228,Grocery,"Well?if you wanted to go 9:30,I could go September 1rst.",OM
2,229,Wine,Yeah that would be perfect.,RP
2,230,Grocery:,That will work for you?,QM
2,231,Wine:,"Yeah,that?s better.",MIN
2,232,Wine:,Okay.,MIN
2,233,Grocery,"And?you don?t wanna go back up to 25 for the renovation cost do you,cause that, that would help me out a little bit.",OM
2,234,Wine,Um?well?I think that would make money after this.,SBR
2,235,Wine,I don?t think that?s really a big issue.,SBR
2,236,Wine,Just one time spent.,SBR
2,237,Grocery,Yeah were finished.,MIN
3,0,Group 03
3,1,Name of Coder: Pooja
3,2,Date:4/12/06
3,3,Grocery,"Hi,my name is Bo /and I?d like to cooperate with you about the new grocery store.",MIC/MIC
3,4,Grocery," I guess we have several problems to discuss with,like the hours of operation, the renovation; I guess we have the same issues to talk about.",MIC
3,5,Grocery,What do you prefer for the hours of operation?,QP
3,6,Wine,"Well,because my store is a wine store,/ we really need to have the hours open a little bit later",SBR/ IP
3,7,Wine,"because people are typically bringing in,coming in to get wine a little bit later for their dinners, or for parties.",SBR
3,8,Wine,"So,we?re hoping to stay, to open a little bit later, and close a little bit later, /so that people can, our customers can come in and buy. ",IP/ SBR
3,9,Wine,What I was hoping was to open around 10:30 and close around 10:30 at night.,IP
3,10,Wine,I know you?re a bread store so you probably have different needs.,IN-P
3,11,Grocery,"Yeah,it?s a little bit, like,  inconvenient for me",RN
3,12,Grocery," because the type of grocery store we sell bread,coffee, which is the breakfast issue.",SBR
3,13,Grocery,"So,well the, the best thing I was hoping is as early as possible like 6am, 6:30 in the morning",IP
3,14,Grocery," and I?m trying to see if we can get some agreement,like, if I open a little bit later and you move the schedule a little bit earlier, so we could be better ?so?",PC
3,15,Wine,"Yeah,I can see why you want to open early because people will be coming in to get breakfast things, and",IN-P
3,16,Grocery,"Otherwise,I wouldn?t have any profit for that.",SBR
3,17,Wine,Right.,MIN
3,18,Wine,"Yeah,I can see how that would be bad.",IN-P
3,19,Wine,"Well since we have to open and shut at the same time,let?s try to see?",MIC
3,20,Wine,you said what time did you want to open?,QP
3,21,Grocery,6:30 to 6:30pm.,IP
3,22,Wine,"Okay,so for me, opening up a little bit earlier wouldn?t hurt my business at all. Although, because I wouldn?t have, I wouldn?t be getting customers.",SBR
3,23,Wine,But closing down early like at 6:30 for my business would be terrible,SBR
3,24,Wine,because then everyone who is coming to get wine for dinners after work would not be served.,SBR
3,25,Grocery,"What is the latest,like the slot you could, I mean, the earliest closing time that you could get?",QP
3,26,Wine,"I think,I?d really like to stay open if not to 10:30, till 9:30/ so that people who are on their way to a party can pick up their wine on their way.",IP/ SBR
3,27,Grocery,When do you prefer to open then?,QP
3,28,Wine,9:30? Would that be okay?,OS
3,29,Grocery,I guess that?s a little bit too late for me.,IP
3,30,Grocery,How about we skip this issue and move on to the rest and then go back to the first one?,PM
3,31,Wine,Okay.,MIN
3,32,Wine,What time would you be willing to close for the hours of operation just to get a sense of?if not 6:30 then?,QP
3,33,Grocery,Like 7:30 would be fine/ ?cause most of work is like 12 hours per day and 7:30 is still tolerable to me just on the breakfast.,IP/SBR
3,34,Grocery,But like 8:30 is maybe a little bit too late,IP
3,35,Grocery,",like, everybody is just going to work and nobody is going to buy their breakfast on their way.",SBR
3,36,Wine,"Okay,well let?s think about this one like you said and maybe we can work it out based on some of the other ones as well.",PM
3,37,Wine,"Do you want to talk about,just go on to renovation costs?",P1
3,38,Grocery,Sure.,MIC
3,39,Wine,Why don?t you go ahead and?what is your need for your market?,QP
3,40,Grocery,"Well,I don?t think I?m going to spend too much on renovation",IP
3,41,Grocery,?cause I had done the research and I feel like it?s not a big deal,SBR
3,42,Grocery,"and I prefer to train my employees better that could save money,like, spend less money in the renovation and train my employees with those money that I save.",SBR
3,43,Grocery," So I prefer like,to spend $10,000 on the renovation,",IP
3,44,Grocery,?cause the situation is not that bad for the hardware of the store?/ so what do you think about it?,SBR/ QP
3,45,Wine,"Well unfortunatley for our wine store,we really think we should have an upscale look, and this, the way the place looks is really not the image we?re going for.",SBR
3,46,Wine," So I wanted to spend a lot more money on that to try to attract the customers from other wine stores and give them the impression that this is a fancy,nice place to shop for their wine.",SBR
3,47,Wine,"So I was hoping to really refurbish mostly the whole store and spend about $30,000 on that.",IP
3,48,Grocery,"Oh,I understand.",MIC
3,49,Grocery,"Well,it sounds too much for me,",IP
3,50,Grocery,"like,the general grocery store is just like the plain store, and we just want to make the customers feel convenient so that?s why I want to put money to train my employees to be more qualified instead of, like, have a really fancy space that they probably wouldn?t find what they need.",SBR
3,51,Grocery,"I guess maybe there?s something that we could spend the certain amount of money,reasonable amount of money, make the store, like, match your convenience and my goals too, both on the same way.",PC
3,52,Grocery,"So maybe there?s some way when we really do the renovations,make your parts more impactive, that  keep mine parts, like, plain so we could use the amount of money we spend, still match your goal.",CS
3,53,Grocery,So what do you think about that?,QM
3,54,Wine,"Yeah,I think that we can do that /and especially if we negotiate on the day that we open,",MIC/CS
3,55,Wine,because what I want for opening is to spend more money and getting it open quicker,IP
3,56,Wine,"but if we,maybe if you want to spend a little bit less money, then we can spend a little bit more time, you know, space out our, or make sure that, hire people that are more willing to work a little bit slowly, and spend a little bit less, and open a little bit later if you want. So we don?t spend as much money,",PP
3,57,Wine,because I wanted to spend a lot of money and get it going right away.,SBR
3,58,Grocery,"Yeah sure,if that works, it will be fine.",MIC
3,59,Grocery,"Like,if we make the store open a bit later.",IP
3,60,Wine,"Ideally,I want to open it quickly",IP
3,61,Wine," but,since you don?t want to spend as much money, we could cut costs that way.",SBR
3,62,Wine," And then,open just a little bit later, but be able to spend, you know?",SBR
3,63,Grocery,"Sure,so let?s discuss those two at the same time.",PP
3,64,Wine,Because those two are related.,PP
3,65,Grocery,"Right,when do you want to open it?",QP
3,66,Wine,I wanted to open May 1.,IP
3,67,Wine,But maybe June 1?,OS
3,68,Wine,We could spend a little bit less money and stretch it over a few more months.,SBR
3,69,Grocery,"How could you make that,like, how much you want to spend and open in June?",QS
3,70,Wine,"About $25,000 I think would,we could save about $5000 from where I wanted and?",IP
3,71,Grocery,"It?s a little tough for me /because in that case,I won?t get much profit and?",RN/SB-R
3,72,Wine,When were you going to open?,QP
3,73,Grocery,"September 1,that?s the ideal case.",IP
3,74,Wine,Okay.,MIN
3,75,Grocery,Because I want to give me enough time to train my employees. You know training people takes time.,SBR
3,76,Wine,Oh okay.,MIN
3,77,Wine,Well if not September then?,QP
3,78,Grocery,"How about like,let?s  keep it October, I mean, sorry, August, so I open it earlier and meanwhile I?ll still keep training my employees and you could spend more, I mean, I could spend more money on the renovation costs. So we could get some balance.",PP
3,79,Wine,"Okay,well then if we open in August, maybe, that way I can use my money with the time that we?re not, well with the time that we?re, by not opening in May but if you?re willing to spend $25,000 to start getting it, or renovate it, then I guess that would kind of even it out, even out the costs.",OM
3,80,Wine,So we?ll open a little bit early and you can recuperate some of those costs.,SBR
3,81,Grocery,"Sure,so that means like, I can open it in August and I spend $25,000?",QM
3,82,Wine,"Yeah,how does that sound, that way, I?m kind of losing money but you?re kind of losing money as well.",MIC
3,83,Grocery,"It?s tough for both people but I think I can still afford that,so it?s fine.",RP
3,84,Wine,"Okay,so maybe your market will look a little bit fancier and?",SBR
3,85,Grocery,"Okay,so how about the floor space that you want to keep on your side?",QP
3,86,Wine,"I,let me see, I?m not sure?",MIN
3,87,Grocery,I prefer to keep like 60% of the floor space,IP
3,88,Grocery,"cause I have a lot of stuff to sell and I want to keep the,like, I got some problem like, keeping the renovation, I mean, the maintenance and rent fee,",SBR
3,89,Grocery,so 60% will be good for me.,IP
3,90,Wine,"Okay,so you need 60% of the floor space in order to put enough products out?",IN-N
3,91,Wine,Okay.,MIN
3,92,Wine," And I needed,my calculation showed that I needed about 40% of the floor space.",IP
3,93,Grocery,Really?,QM
3,94,Grocery,Then that?s perfect match.,RP
3,95,Wine,"Yeah,that works out right?",QM
3,96,Wine,So that sounds good.,RP
3,97,Grocery,"And my stuff,like, I don?t really need the cool temperature",IP
3,98,Grocery," so in order to save electricity like air conditioning,/I want to keep the temperature as high as possible, like 73 degrees.",SBR/ IP
3,99,Grocery,What is your?,QP
3,100,Wine,"Well,since I have wine, some of my wines are supposed to be kept at a lower temperature.",SBR
3,101,Wine,"If the temperature goes up higher,then the product can get spoiled.",SBR
3,102,Wine,"What I want ideally is for my customers to know that we have a good product and we don?t,that our product won?t spoil, or turn bad because of the temperature.",SBR
3,103,Wine,So what I really want is to try to keep it cool in this store.,IP
3,104,Wine,"I want to have it at,our ideal temperature is about 65 degrees",IP
3,105,Wine,"to keep it,to keep our products at the right temperature and from spoiling.",SBR
3,106,Grocery,65?,QM
3,107,Grocery," Well,in that case, I?m going to bring myself in trouble.",RN
3,108,Grocery,So let?s see?,MIN
3,109,Wine,But it sounded like you wanted to try to save on electricity by keeping it warmer?,QM
3,110,Wine,To put more value in as much air conditioning?,QM
3,111,Grocery,"Yes,exactly.",MIN
3,112,Grocery,How about this?,QM
3,113,Grocery,"I probably like,if we keep the temperature higher, but I put more money in the renovations, so you could install more like the cooling system, I mean, the refridgerators, those stuff in your part so you can still keep your wines and the alcohols cold, but you don?t have to keep the whole space with the air conditioning costs.",PP
3,114,Wine,Oh I see.,MIN
3,115,Wine,"Well,the thing is I don?t need refridgerators to keep the wine cold.",SBR
3,116,Grocery,You wan to look at the whole system.,QS
3,117,Wine,"Yeah,I don?t want them as cold as a refridgerator would make them. Like, I don?t want to keep them at 50 degrees or 40 degrees.",SBR
3,118,Wine,"But I just want them about,you know, 65 degrees.",IP
3,119,Wine,"So if I intall a refridgerator,it would make all of the wines too cold if I put all of the wine in the refridgerator.",SBR
3,120,Grocery,Let?s see.,MIN
3,121,Grocery,"Well,65 degrees is still like, too cold for me.",IP
3,122,Grocery,"And how about like,and I reduce it to 71 degrees?",OS
3,123,Wine,71?,QM
3,124,Wine,"Well,I guess in terms of the wine, that makes a lot of difference.",RN
3,125,Wine,"Between 71 and 65,that?s 6 degrees, it?s still that, it?s really pushing it for how the product will spoil,",SBR
3,126,Wine,"and plus,are you going to be selling vegetables and cold things as well in your market?",SBR
3,127,Grocery,"I guess probably the main part is the bakeries,the pastries?",SBR
3,128,Wine,"Okay,okay, so you don?t need to keep any of those things very cold.",IN-N
3,129,Grocery,"Right,so I don?t sell very many fresh food. I mean the vegetables.",SBR
3,130,Wine,Oh okay.,MIN
3,131,Wine,"So,well, how about?how about if it?s, I guess if it?s 65 then that?s the best",IP
3,132,Wine,but if it?s a little warmer than that by just a few degrees it won?t matter very much. Especially if the wine is being sold quickly.,SBR
3,133,Wine,"If my product sits in there for months at 71 degrees,then it?s not going to work out.",SBR
3,134,Wine,"But how about if it?s,if we can agree on it being about 67 degrees?",OS
3,135,Grocery,"I understand your difficulties / but considering we?re all businesswoman,so 67 will still like, cost me too much for the air conditioning parts",MIC/ IP
3,136,Grocery,because I really don?t need that parts so it?s a bummer for me.,SBR
3,137,Wine,Don?t you think your customers will get hot in there? When they come and visit your store?,SBR
3,138,Grocery,"Most of them will just do their quick daily grocery shopping,and 71 or 73 will work perfect for them.",SBR
3,139,Wine,Well I have an idea.,MIN
3,140,Wine,"If  I agree to having it a little bit warmer like 69,that would be okay with me as long as I can make sure that the wine gets moving. Like I sell it at the appropriate hours.",PP
3,141,Grocery,You know what?,MIN
3,142,Grocery,"Actually,if we open the store earlier, the temperature wouldn?t be that high naturally",SBR
3,143,Grocery,so how about like we open it at 7:30 to 7pm?,,And maybe keep the air conditioning working at 69 degrees?,OM
3,144,Grocery,"So in earlier time,the temperature wouldn?t rise high too much and it will reduce the cost of the air conditioning, naturally. Save energy naturally.",SBR
3,145,Wine,That?s a good point.,MIC
3,146,Wine,"What I think?maybe we should?still 7:30 for me is closing a little bit early,",IP
3,147,Wine,I think for people who want to watch and come and buy wine after work for dinner or party.,SBR
3,148,Wine," Just so that you know,if you ever try to go buy wine, usually, you?re getting it on the way to go to your friend?s house for dinner so I?m afraid that if I?m closed at that time, then they won?t remember my store.",SBR
3,149,Wine,They won?t come back you know.,SBR
3,150,Wine,They?ll go to the other store down the street.,SBR
3,151,Wine,"So I?m thinking that if we can open at 8:30 in the morning to 8:30 pm,then I guess we could keep it, well, cuz that?s a better time for me in that maybe we can keep it at 71 degrees.",OM
3,152,Grocery,"Okay,that works.",RP
3,153,Grocery,So let?s keep it at 71 and open a little later.,MIN
3,154,Wine,"Hold on,hold on, hold on.",MIN
3,155,Wine,"I think that might,hold on, not work.",RN
3,156,Wine,Because I?m afraid that?well?I?m afraid that it might make it a little too hot in there.,SBR
3,157,Wine,"If we opened at,if we kept it at 67 degrees and we opened at 7:30 to 7:30, I would be willing to kinda make that bargain.",OM
3,158,Wine,"By keeping it colder,my product will be fresher, and maybe they would, people would say, well, that would make people want to come back.",SBR
3,159,Grocery,"I understand your difficulties/ but in order to make profit for myself because I really did some research,and if, if going that way, I probably wouldn?t make much profit.",IN-P/SB-R
3,160,Grocery,"Like,in some cases, I probably would lose money.",SBR
3,161,Grocery,So my bottom line is either/ we open at 7:30 to 7:30 at 69 degrees /or 8:30 to 8:30 at 71 degrees.,IB/ OM/OM
3,162,Wine,"Well,both of those options don?t work very well for me",RN
3,163,Wine,because they make me lose out on both of the things that are important to my business.,SBR
3,164,Wine,"So what I propose is to make some in the middle for both of us,where neither, I mean where you?re losing out some and I?m losing out some but we?re both gaining in certain things.",PC
3,165,Wine,"So my ideal would be,I guess, if we opened at 8:30 and closed at 8:30 and keep it at 69 degrees.",OM
3,166,Grocery,"Okay,I agree with that.",RP
3,167,Wine,Does that work for you?,QM
3,168,Wine,"And then,you know, if it turns out we can always come back and talk about our hours later because we can try it out when we start in August and see if it works out.",CS
3,169,Wine,"If it doesn?t,we can always come back and talk about it.",MIC
3,170,Grocery,"Exactly,I agree with that.",MIC
3,171,Grocery,We can set it to run to have some experiment for the first one or two months so we can get enough information to make a little bit of judgements.,MIC
3,172,Wine,"Yeah,and we could in the future get to an agreement with sharing our employees somehow so that if you really need to open early, and then some of the employees can come in at that time and watch, you know one person watch my store where rest of the employees are all in the market.",CS
3,173,Grocery,"That?s a really good idea,yeah, that?s a good idea.",MIC
3,174,Wine,"Because unfortunately our hours of operation are completely off. But we have to open at the same time,so. / Because nobody?s going to be buying wine at 8:30, or 7:30, or 6:30.",IDN/ SBR
3,175,Grocery,I was hoping they could still buy their breakfast at 8:30.,SBR
3,176,Wine,So maybe later we can see how that goes and work out an earlier and a later time.,CS
3,177,Grocery,"Yeah,I agree with that.",MIC
3,178,Grocery,Let?s just start it with this schedule and move on and see what happens.,MIN
3,179,Wine,"Yeah,because I think it would be best for both of us if we opened really early and stayed opened really late, because you know, even with the market, people want to come and get chips, or lots of ingredients late at night.",MU
3,180,Wine,Grocery," I understand that,so I guess that?s it.",MIC
3,181,Wine,Guess that?s it.,MIN
3,182,Wine,"Okay,well, we?ll be working together again.",MIC
3,183,Grocery,Thank you.,MIC
3,184,Wine,Thank you.,MIC

4,4,Wine,Yeah sure./,MI-C
4,5,Grocery,"I have five issues we have to talk about our operation,when we should close our space, and temperature and grand opening date./",PO

4,7,Grocery,"Yeah,our fifth issue I think?/",MI-N
4,8,Grocery,"My main concern would be the hour of operation,the temperature, and the grand opening date?/",IR
4,9,Grocery,they will make me the deal but other than that we can negotiate./,PO
4,10,Wine,Of course./,MI-N
4,11,Wine,How important is floor space to you?/,QR
4,12,Wine,Is floor space less important to you?,QR

4,14,Grocery,How about you?/,QM
4,15,Wine,"Yeah,floor space is negotiable./",PC
4,16,Grocery,"Negotiable,uh huh./",MI-N
4,17,Wine,So for the temperature how would you feel about say 69 degrees?/,OS
4,18,Grocery,Well?because?let me think./,MI-N
4,19,Wine,You could do better?/,QP
4,20,Grocery,"Yeah I can do better for that yeah,but we can think about that./",MI-N
4,21,Wine,Ok I?ll think about that one./,MI-N
4,22,Grocery,Yeah I think yeah the more important issue for me is the grand opening date./,IR
4,23,Grocery,How about you?/,QR
4,24,Grocery,What is the most important issue for you?/,QR
4,25,Wine,Hours of operation is important to me to/,IR
4,26,Wine,"but you know,if you?ve got an opening date you were more comfortable with I could get hours that maybe I was more comfortable with depending?/",PP
4,27,Grocery,Depending on um hum I could talk about the points right here in the packet./,OT

4,29,Grocery,The points here./,OT
4,30,Wine,"Um,I?m sorry one more time?/",QM

4,36,Grocery,Anyway yeah./,MI-N
4,37,Grocery,How about the grand opening date?/,QP
4,38,Grocery,"For me I think if the grand opening date is at Spetember 1st,that would be the best for me/",IP
4,39,Wine,Ok well I would do well with hours of operation from 10:30 AM to 10:30 PM./,IP
4,40,Wine,That wouldn?t be the best for you?/,QM
4,41,Grocery,"Yeah,I think so yeah./",MI-N
4,42,Wine,That would work well for you?/,QM
4,43,Grocery,"This not work well for me,/",RN
4,44,Grocery,but I think umm you know we can make a deal here./,PP
4,45,Wine,Ok so like September 1st opening date?/,OS
4,46,Grocery,"And our hours of operation,10:00 to 10:30 yeah./",OM
4,47,Wine,"Ok,that works for me./",RP 
4,48,Wine,So you said renovation costs were less important to you but temperature was more important?/,QR
4,49,Grocery,Yeah temperature is very important for me you know./,IR
4,50,Grocery,My grocery store has fresh fruit; I cannot have a temperature that you know/,SB-R
4,51,Grocery,yeah but the renovation costs I don?t want to spend much too yeah./,IP
4,52,Grocery,That?s for many reasons./,SB-R
4,53,Wine,"Right,so you don?t want to spend much on renovation costs but you would want um a lower temperature for the fruit or a higher temperature for the fruit?/",QP
4,54,Grocery,A higher temperature./,IP
4,55,Wine,"For the fruit,ok./",MI-N
4,56,Grocery,What is the temperature you think you would like to have?/,QP
4,57,Wine,Um I?m somewhat negotiable on the temperature./,PC
4,58,Wine,The renovation costs would be more important to me/,IR
4,59,Wine,so I could be willing to go for a lower temperature if we spent a little bit more on renovation costs./,PP
4,60,Grocery,Well for me temperature is more important./,IR
4,61,Grocery,I think the temperature is high the best for me./,IP
4,62,Grocery,The renovation costs is not my immediate issue./,IR
4,63,Grocery,I mean you know it is an important issue for me too but?./,IR
4,64,Wine,"Well what if we did a higher temperature like 73 degrees but we also did a higher renovation cost like 30,000 dollars./",OM
4,65,Grocery,Oh that would be good for me./,RP
4,66,Wine,That would be a good trade off for you?/,QM
4,67,Wine,Well that works for me too./,MI-C
4,68,Grocery,So the floor space you need?For the floor space I need more actually./,IP
4,69,Wine,"Ok,Um I guess we could do?So you would want like 60 percent?/",OS
4,70,Grocery,Yeah I would like to have 60 percent./,IP
4,71,Wine,I can do that./,MI-C
4,72,Wine,"40 percent for me,ok that works for me/",RP
4,73,Grocery,Ok then./,MI-N
4,74,Wine,We agreed on that./,MI-C
4,75,Wine,"Ok,so its 10:30 am opening hours, $30,000 renovation costs, 40 percent floor for me 60 percent for you, 73 degrees, September 1st./",MI-N
4,76,Wine,That?s great./,MI-C
4,77,Grocery,That?s great we?re done./,OT
4,78,Grocery,"If I was real owner you know,the operating hours would not be that you know because in long run it?s more important./",OT
4,79,Wine,Well see I got my first second and fourth choice I got the most value on./,OT
4,80,Wine,Ok we?re done./,OT
4,81,Wine,We?re just trading secrets now./,OT
5,0,Wine,"My English is not that clear,so I try to make myself clear ok?",MI-C

5,2,Wine,Oh I think I will try to practice my English so?,MI-C
5,3,Grocery,"Ok,well if there is anyway I can help let me know.",MI-C
5,4,Grocery,"Umm,well Celine it looks like we are going to go into business together here or we are going to put our businesses together in the same place.",MI-C
5,5,Grocery,"Umm and we both want this to be successful so there are five things we need to figure out together in order to do this project,and those are what hours we should be open, how much to spend making the place look nice, renovating; how to divide up the floor space you know who gets how much space, how warm or cold the store should be what temperature it should be and what date we want to open.",PO
5,6,Grocery,So maybe the first thing we should do is say what each of us would like on each of those.,PO
5,7,Grocery,Is that best thing to do or?,QM
5,8,Wine,So when is your hope to hour of operation?,QP
5,9,Grocery,Well I would like to open as early as I can /because I serve?my store serves breakfast /so the earlier we can open the better it would be for us. So 6:30 in the morning to 6:30 in the evening would be the best time for me.,IP/SB-R/IP
5,10,Grocery,,
5,11,Wine,Really?,QM
5,12,Grocery,What would be best for you?,QP
5,13,Wine,Well as you know we are liquor shop/so the later is better for us,SF/IP
5,14,Wine,so can we find balance?,PC
5,15,Grocery,What would be best for you?,QP
5,16,Wine,I prefer 10:30 to 10:30 pm.,IP
5,17,Grocery,Do you think people really shop for wine at 10:30pm?,QS
5,18,Wine,"Yes I think so,look at most under students.",SB-R
5,19,Grocery,"Well if we open at 10:30,we won?t be able to sell any of our breakfast items because most people want to get their breakfast items on their way to work.",SB-R
5,20,Wine,But only umm?You are grocery store right and?,MI-N
5,21,Grocery,"Yes,but we have a deli.",SBR
5,22,Grocery,We have uh?,MI-N
5,23,Wine,A deli and so for breakfast.,MIN
5,24,Wine,Is it possible that um you only open the deli in the morning and other place we can open together?,CS
5,25,Grocery,"They do give us that as an option,unfortunately that?s what I thought too.",MI-C
5,26,Grocery," I sell coffee,specialty pastries and other breakfast items so I have kind of a bakery and umm?",SF
5,27,Wine,I normally shop grocery in that morning?Most people who come out for breakfast they will go to for work right and it?s impossible for them to shop grocery because they don?t have time to bring them home.,SB-R
5,28,Grocery,Right I wish there was a way we could just open the breakfast part in the morning but they didn?t give that as one of the options.,OT
5,29,Grocery,Cause to me that would make sense.,MIN
5,30,Wine,Yeah.,MI-N
5,31,Grocery,"Umm ok,well let?s just find out where we are on each of the other issues and then we can figure out where we can compromise.",PO
5,32,Grocery,What about renovation costs how much do you think we need to spend to make the store look nice?,QP
5,33,Wine,"I wish it to be 30,000 dollars.",IP
5,34,Grocery,You think it needs a lot of work?,QS
5,35,Wine,Yes and I want to have a shop with high quality and uhh yeah that?s it.,SB-R
5,36,Grocery,"Umm,well I had my interior designer look at the place and she is very creative and she thinks that for 10,000 dollars we can make it look very nice and also the outside of the store to put nice signage and some plants and things like that to make it look nice outdoors and she gave me an estimate for 10,000 dollars umm",SBR
5,37,Grocery,so we?ll come back to that one too.,PM
5,38,Grocery,What about floor space? How much do you need?,QP
5,39,Wine,I think from 30 percent to 40 percent,IP
5,40,Wine," because I need some place to display my wine and you know,you can put wine like this.",SB-R
5,41,Wine,You have to put correct so?,MI-N
5,42,Grocery,So you need 40 percent of the space.,IN-N
5,43,Wine,At least thirty percent.,IP
5,44,Grocery,"Well I was thinking that 60 percent would be good for us,about 60 percent of the floor space,",IP
5,45,Grocery,"so what do you think,would 60/40 be good on that one?",OS
5,46,Grocery,If we had 60 percent?,MI-N
5,47,Wine,You totally sure 60 percent and?,MI-N
5,48,Grocery,I have 60 percent and you have 40 percent,MIN
5,49,Wine,Ok yeah sure that?s great.,RP
5,50,Grocery,Does that work?,QM
5,51,Grocery,Ok well let?s agree on that one.,MI-C
5,52,Grocery,And what about temperature umm what temperature do you think the store should be?,QP
5,53,Wine,Umm I think our best situation is 45 degree,MIN
5,54,Grocery,45?,QM
5,55,Wine,Oh no 65.,IP
5,56,Grocery,"65 degrees,ok.",MI-N
5,57,Wine,For our wines it?s too hot in my shop.,SB-R
5,58,Grocery,Umhmm.,MI-N
5,59,Grocery,That?s going to be very expensive to keep the store that cold because there are people coming in and out all of the time and the air conditioning is going to cost a lot of money in the summertime to keep it that cold.,SB-R
5,60,Grocery,For most of the things we sell 73 degrees would be fine.,IP
5,61,Wine,73 ok?do you think that is a little bit too hot?,QS
5,62,Grocery,I think we could go a little bit cooler than that.,PC
5,63,Wine,So how about 69?,OS
5,64,Grocery,"I think 69 degree could work,",RP
5,65,Grocery,cause we want it cool enough so that people feel comfortable and our food stays fresh but we don?t want to spend a fortune on electricity.,SB-R
5,66,Grocery," Um,now what date were you hoping to open the store?",QP
5,67,Wine,"I think the earlier the better,so I wish it to be May 1st.",IP
5,68,Grocery,So are you all ready?,QS
5,69,Grocery,Do you have all the things you need to open it?s going to take some time to do all the renovations and get everything?,SB-R
5,70,Wine,Yes I have a wine collection of wine.,SB-R
5,71,Wine,I already have them so I wish to open as early as possible.,IP
5,72,Grocery,I would like to open as late as possible,IP
5,73,Wine,Really why?,QS
5,74,Grocery,Because umm well first of all it is going to take some time to get the store prepared the physical space prepared,SB-R
5,75,Grocery,a lot of the items I sell need to be ordered from overseas from abroad,SB-R
5,76,Grocery,and the main thing is I want to make sure we hire good staff and train them well so they can give good customer service because I think that the umm?,SB-R
5,77,Wine,I have a question.,MI-N
5,78,Wine,"When is the time we talk about,when is now?",QM
5,79,Grocery,I don?t know but for me September 1st would be ideal,IP
5,80,Grocery,because that is a time when people are really?that?s a good time to open a business.,Sb-R
5,81,Grocery," It?s a good time to start something new because people are more focused,they are ready.",SB-R
5,82,Grocery,I couldn?t open before August 1st,IB
5,83,Grocery,but September 1st would be even better,IP
5,84,Grocery,because that gives?that?s a better time to open a store than in August.,SB-R
5,85,Grocery,In August people are on vacation they are away they are not really paying attention.,SB-R
5,86,Wine,If we can open this business it means that we already paid the rent and we already know the place,SB-R
5,87,Wine,and if you open so late there will be a lot of cost and only thing you sell is your staff that charge of training your staff,SB-R
5,88,Grocery,Right I mean to hire staff and train them.,SB-R
5,89,Grocery,I guess we both need to train our staff.,SB-R
5,90,Wine,It?s too expensive!,RN
5,91,Wine,"It?s umm two three or four months you pay the utility,the rent and you have already spent a lot of money in it and you just?",SB-R
5,92,Wine,how do you say?you just let the price stay there and do you think it?s ok for you?,QM
5,93,Grocery,Well umm the good thing is that I won?t have most of the items that I need to sell.,SB-R
5,94,Grocery,I mean the soonest I could open would be August 1st,IB
5,95,Grocery,but even that would be hard because so much of my supplies have to come from far away and so if I open before that I really wouldn?t have much to sell,SB-R
5,96,Grocery,and also I don?t think we would have the place really looking nice and have our staff all trained before then.,SB-R
5,97,Wine,"Ummm ok,you wish it to be August 1st and I wish it to be May 1st.",ID-N
5,98,Grocery,Actually I wish it to be September 1st.,IP
5,99,Wine,I know but um could it be possible that I make a compromise to July 1st and we raise a little the renovation cost,PP
5,100,Wine,"because I have the lost for the rent for two months,it is huge money right?",SB-R
5,101,Grocery,It is huge money but I think we would be better off opening in September when people are more likely to be there and pay attention.,SB-R
5,102,Grocery,,
5,103,Wine,No,RN
5,104,Wine,I mean I can make a compromise to?a little bit and maybe you can make conversation in renovation costs.,PP
5,105,Wine,Do you understand what I mean?,QM
5,106,Grocery,So you are saying if I pay more of the renovation cost?,PP
5,107,Wine,Yes and I will make a compromise to make the date later.,PP
5,108,Grocery,Ok well could you go for August 1st and then I would come up a lot in the renovation cost if we could go for August 1st.,PP
5,109,Wine,"You mean you will pay for 30,000?",QM
5,110,Grocery,"I will pay for 20,000.",OM
5,111,Wine,"20,000.00",MI-N
5,112,Wine,"July 1st and you pay 20,000 ok?",OM
5,113,Grocery,"How about August 1st and I pay 25,000?",OM
5,114,Wine,"Ummm no,",RN
5,115,Wine," if it is August 1st then it goes to 30,000",OM
5,116,Wine,because I already have my staff.,SB-R
5,117,Wine,I already have my product and I just put all in there and work for you.,SB-R
5,118,Grocery,Let me think about that one.,MI-N
5,119,Grocery,"Now about these hours of operation,I really need to be open in the early morning and I can understand that you need to be open in the evening because people are often picking up wine for dinner.",ID-P
5,120,Wine,And those people who come there they will also buy some snacks in your shop right?,SB-R
5,121,Grocery,That?s true but we would miss our breakfast business.,SB-R
5,122,Wine,Well this is near the campus I think most people will have party in the night.,SB-R
5,123,Grocery,Well could we say 7:30 to 7:30?,OS
5,124,Wine,No.,RN
5,125,Wine,I think my bottom line is 9:30 to 9:30pm.,IB
5,126,Grocery,I just can?t do that/ because I would completely miss my breakfast business.,RN/ SB-R
5,127,Wine,"I know?Why if there is no option for a more flexible one then we cannot choose,why?",OT
5,128,Grocery,Yeah I wish there was.,MI-C
5,129,Grocery,I wish I could open just that part at 6:30 and you could be open till 10:30 with the wine cause we could close down that deli part.,MI-N
5,130,Grocery,Well I?ll tell you what.,MI-N
5,131,Grocery,"If we can open on September 1st,then I?ll compromise at 8:30 to 8:30 on the hours of operation.",OM
5,132,Wine,"No,for me that is too far.",RN
5,133,Wine,My boss would kill me.,SB-R
5,134,Grocery,"You are the boss,this is your store.",SF
5,135,Wine,"Well September and cost of 25,000?",OM
5,136,Grocery,"September cost of 25,000 and 8:30 to 8:30?",OM
5,137,Wine,"How about 8:30 to 8:30 and I will and? 25,000 and that?s open in July 1st.",OM
5,138,Grocery,Yeah I just can?t open that soon,RN
5,139,Wine,Can you just sell a part of your product?,QM
5,140,Grocery,I wish I could.,MI-C
5,141,Wine,And I can help training your staff because my company is really good with it.,SB-R
5,142,Grocery,I appreciate that but we just aren?t going to be ready to open before September 1st.,SB-R
5,143,Grocery,I mean if we really pushed it we could make it August 1st but I just don?t think that is a very good time to open a store.,SB-R
5,144,Wine,But already two months later than I wish.,SB-R
5,145,Grocery,"Well how about if we make it August 1st ,25, 000 and 8:30 to 8:30?",OM
5,146,Wine,I think that is a little?I think it?s not enough.,RN
5,147,Grocery,"Ok,how about August 1st I pick up all 30,000 and we go 8:30 to 8:30?",OM
5,148,Grocery,That means that I am paying 5000 dollars more.,SB-R
5,149,Wine,"I know,but you know the rent per month is higher than 5000 I think.",SB-R
5,150,Grocery,Oh no.,RN
5,151,Grocery,So yeah I mean I can go for that extra 5000 if we can open on August 1st.,OM
5,152,Grocery,August 1st is really pushing it for me.,IP
5,153,Wine,"Yeah but I have to pay two to three month rent for you,for long time, three months is quite long for business right?",SB-R
5,154,Grocery,Well it is but I think it?s going to take us a while to get the store all ready and get everything ready to open and get all of our products there so that?s really going to be?,SB-R
5,155,Grocery,I just can?t do it that soon.,RN
5,156,Grocery,I just can?t do it in? I can?t be ready by July.,SB-R
5,157,Wine,You can?t be ready by July.,MI-N
5,158,Grocery,But I tell you what.,MI-N
5,159,Grocery,I could go a little bit later on the hours.,PC
5,160,Grocery,"We could go 9:30 to 9:30,if I could have an August 1st opening.",OM
5,161,Wine,9:30 to 9:30?and you pay all the renovation cost?,QM
5,162,Grocery,"No I?ll pay 25,000 of the renovation cost if we open from 9:30 to 9:30",OM
5,163,Grocery,because I just can?t umm I just can?t lose that?,SB-R
5,164,Grocery,8:30 is already really cutting into my breakfast business but 8:30 in the evening gives you time to pick up the crowd that?s umm you know doing recreation after dinner or picking up wine for dinner and all that you know? wine on the way home from work.,SB-R
5,165,Grocery,Umm so if we go later I would need to?,SB-R
5,166,Grocery,I can?t pay that extra 5000 dollars because I am going to lose a lot of business in the morning.,SB-R
5,167,Wine,But for me it is a little lose for my business in the night right?,SB-R
5,168,Grocery,Right but?,MI-N
5,169,Wine,So we both make compromise right.,PC
5,170,Grocery,So do you want to compromise from 8:30 to 8:30 on the hours?,PC
5,171,Wine,"No,I want to compromise to 9:30 to 9:30.",IP
5,172,Grocery,Well I am offering to do that but I won?t pick up all the renovation costs if I do that.,PP
5,173,Grocery,"I will only pick up 25,000 but I would absolutely need to open no sooner than August 1st.",OM
5,174,Wine,"Ok,let?s make it 9:30 to 9:30 and you pay for 30,000 and I we can work for you till August 1st. ",OM
5,175,Wine,Is that ok?,QM
5,176,Grocery,"No,/ I would have to pay 25,000 of the renovation cost because I just can?t afford the extra 5000 if I am losing that breakfast business.",RN/ SB-R
5,177,Grocery,I am happy to pick up all 30000 if we can go from 8:30 to 8:30 and open on August 1st.,OM
5,178,Wine,Ok so let?s check the first one.,MI-N
5,179,Wine,"9:30 to 9:30 and you pay for 25,000 and let?s open on August 1st.",OM
5,180,Grocery,"Ok,9:30 to 9:30, 25,000 and August 1st.",RP
5,181,Wine,Since this is make a cash and make a deal.,MI-N
5,182,Grocery,"We made a deal,yeah.",MI-C
5,183,Grocery,"Ok so if the hours are 9:30 to 9:30,we are paying 25,000 in renovation costs, we are splitting the store 60 percent for me 40 percent for you., 69 degrees would be the temperature, and August 1st would be the opening date.",MI-N
5,184,Grocery,Ok,MI-N
5,185,Wine,Ok.,MI-N
5,186,Grocery,So how did you do?,OT
5,187,Grocery,Did you do your score there?,OT
5,188,Wine,Ummm? 720.,OT
5,189,Grocery,Alright.,OT
5,190,I got 600,OT
5,191,Wine,?..,OT
7,0,Wine,Ok let?s get started./,PO
7,1,Grocery,So umm nice to share room with you./,MI-C
7,2,Wine,Yeah looking forward to this space I think it is a good idea and I am glad you guys approached us about it./,MI-C
7,3,Wine,So I know there?s some issues that we just need to work out before we actually move in./,PO
7,4,Grocery,Yeah that we don?t need to work out./,MI-N
7,5,Wine,That we don?t need to work out?/,QM
7,6,Grocery,NO I mean?/,MI-N
7,7,Wine,Ok so what issue would you like to start with?,P1
7,8,Wine,Would you wanna?/,MI-N
7,9,Grocery,How about you?/,QM
7,10,Wine,"Let?s start by talking about the space some itself. So first of all,the space itself./",P1
7,11,Wine,,We have a big space we each get part of it./,MIN
7,12,Wine,What percentage of that space would you like?/,QP
7,13,Grocery,I want 70 percent./,IP
7,14,Wine,70 percent?/,QM
7,15,Grocery,"Yeah you know,I occupy a larger space so I will pay much more rent than you./",SB-R
7,16,Wine,"And I agree that you should have a larger space because groceries do take up more room than liquor,/ so how about you get 60 percent of the space?/",MIC/OS
7,17,Grocery,60 percent? Do you need so much space?/,QS
7,18,Wine,I do actually./,MIN
7,19,Grocery,Really?/,QM
7,20,Wine,Uh huh./,MI-N
7,21,Wine,"When we are talking about specialty wines from all around the world,it is going to take up a lot of room but it is also going to be beneficial to your customers/",SB-R
7,22,Wine,"because they can come in,pick out a particular food and then ask the wine expert, well what goes nicely with this food and we will have everything right there on display./",SB-R
7,23,Wine,"Or if they are looking at a particular wine,your people can recommend many choices that go with that wine/",SB-R
7,24,Wine,"so to have everything right there instead of having it in storage at an off location,we can instantly provide the customers with both sides of what they are looking for./",SB-R
7,25,Grocery,Yes I think so but I also need space./,SB-R
7,26,Wine,"Right,and you are getting almost as much space as you are asking for./",SB-R
7,27,Grocery,"So if I want to a little less space than I need,may I get something else such as the hour?/",PX
7,28,Wine,"Well it depends,what hours are you interested in./",QP
7,29,Grocery,You know I have breakfast for the people./,SB-R
7,30,Wine,"Breakfast,they never mentioned anything to me about breakfast in this./",MI-N
7,31,Grocery,"Some coffee or cookie such like this,so I want to open an hour earlier./",IP
7,32,Wine,"Ok well what is an hour earlier,what time?/",QP
7,33,Grocery,"Umm,how about 6 o?clock?/",OS
7,34,Wine,"Absolutely not,I  don?t come in that early./",RN
7,35,Wine,"Besides I can?t sell alcohol at that time of the day,it is illegal in most places./",SB-R
7,36,Grocery,It?s illegal?/,QS
7,37,Wine,"It?s illegal in most places to sell alcohol before certain hours,after certain hours, or on Sundays./",SB-R
7,38,Grocery,Ohh./,MI-N
7,39,Grocery,Wine,I don?t know if that all applies in D.C. but in most place it is and so we would then have to close my half of the store and the customers would have to look at products they can?t buy because it is illegal for them to purchase it that early./,SB-R
7,40,Grocery,But you know some workers go to work very earlier./,SB-R
7,41,Wine,In Dupont circle a lot of people stay out late. You get a lot more night owls in Dupont Circle then you have early morning people./,SB-R
7,42,Wine,You ever hung out in Dupont?/,QM
7,43,Grocery,"Yeah I know,but the breakfast is very early and it will be too much work/",SB-R
7,44,Wine,And I see that you are going to be serving some breakfast./,IN-N
7,45,Wine,Now I would prefer to open at 10:30./,IP
7,46,Wine,And I realize you are going to miss your breakfast hour there./,IN-P
7,47,Grocery,"Oh if we open at 10:30,everybody will have lunch./",SB-R
7,48,Wine,I eat breakfast at 10:30./,SB-R
7,49,Grocery,Oh but it is only you not almost average people./,SB-R
7,50,Wine,"Everybody I work with eats breakfast at 10:30,/",SB-R
7,51,Wine,but what I am saying is that I am willing to compromise some on those hours / and we could open at say 9:30 instead./,PC/OS
7,52,Grocery,9:30?/,RN
7,53,Grocery,I don?t think I have no business if we open that late./,SB-R
7,54,Wine,So breakfast makes it what percentage of you profit?/,QS
7,55,Grocery,It?s a main part/,SB-R
7,56,Wine,"Well,give me a percentage./",QP
7,57,Grocery,Maybe 40 percent./,IP
7,58,Wine,40 percent of your profits?/,QM
7,59,Grocery,Yeah./,MI-N
7,60,Wine,Then why are they putting it together at all?/,QS
7,61,Wine,If I am selling alcohol and you are selling breakfast then this isn?t going to work out for Benducci either./,MI-Neg
7,62,Grocery,Ahh of course we can./,MI-neg
7,63,Grocery,"We can make short with the hour but can you let me open up earlier,I can give you more space./",PP
7,64,Wine,I am actually more interested in?/,MI-N
7,65,Wine,Well ok if you were to open at 8:30 what time would we close?/,QP
7,66,Wine,Have you ever tried to buy a bottle of wine at 9 o?clock at night and find that you can?t because the store is closed?/,SB-R
7,67,Wine,"It?s very frustrating actually,I?ve actually done that.  I?ve gone to a liquor store at 9 o?clock at night. It?s the evening and I want to buy a bottle of wine and I can?t because it?s closed./",SB-R
7,68,Wine,It drives a lot of business away so I think we need to find a common ground here between you still getting your breakfast and me still getting my evening customers./,PC
7,69,Grocery,Ok so let?s open earlier and close later./,CS
7,70,Wine,If we are allowed to do that I think that is a great deal./,OT
7,71,Wine,I think the woman in the next room here would tell us that we can?t do that./,OT
7,72,Wine,"But we can think about that and move on to other issues and we will come back to that one,cause actually the hours? yeah so we?ll come back to that one./",PM
7,73,Wine,Now once again talking about the space itself. Have you seen the space?/,MIN
7,74,Grocery,Space you mean?/,QM
7,75,Wine,The physical space that we?re gonna be moving into?/,MIN
7,76,Grocery,Yeah I occupy the 60 percent./,MIN
7,77,Wine,No I am not talking about that now. What I am talking about is the physical space that we will be moving into./,MI-N
7,78,Wine,Have you actually seen it?/,MI-N
7,79,Wine,You say you know what it looks like./,MI-N
7,80,Grocery,Oh you mean the?/,QM
7,81,Wine,The place where we are going to be occupying./,MI-N
7,82,Wine,Because it is going to need a little bit of work I think. In order to make it presentable for customers./,SB-R
7,83,Grocery,"I?m sorry,wait, we should discuss floor space or?/",P1
7,84,Wine,"No,renovation costs./",P1
7,85,Grocery,Renovation costs./,MI-N
7,86,Grocery,Ok./,MI-N
7,87,Grocery,So you need a lot of money to negotiate to renovate?/,QP
7,88,Wine,I think that we are going to need to spend some money or at least I am willing to spend some money on renovations./,IP
7,89,Wine,So this would just be money out of my pockets./,SB-R
7,90,Grocery,So how much would you like to spend on your??/,QP
7,91,Wine,"I would like to spend 30,000 dollars on the renovations./",IP
7,92,Grocery,So you want to spend?/,MI-N
7,93,Wine,Yeah just out of my pockets./,MIN
7,94,Grocery,So how much would you like me to spend?/,QM
7,95,Wine,Whatever you?d like./,MI-N
7,96,Grocery,"OK so I am willing to spend 10,000./",IP
7,97,Wine,Of your money?/,QM
7,98,Wine,"That?s fine as long as there is 30,000 of mine./",CS
7,99,Wine,But then initially there would be a bigger return for me on the percentage of profits if I am going to be spending more money on the renovations up front./,SB-R
7,100,Grocery,"So you want this space,40 percent?/",OS
7,101,Wine,I didn?t know we were on that. I was still talking about renovation money./,P1
7,102,Grocery,Oh excuse me./,MI-N
7,103,Grocery,I make a mistake./,MI-N
7,104,Grocery,"So you want to spend 30,000 money. I want to spend 10,000 money./",ID-N
7,105,Grocery,Wine,"Ok,well according to what they gave us here which is complete I think that is fine/",OT
7,106,Grocery,"because I will spend 30,000 and you will spend 10,000 so total we?ll have 40,000 dollars for renovations. So I think that works fine./",CS
7,107,Grocery,Ok so let?s move the next so?/,PM
7,108,Wine,So we still haven?t completed our hours of operation but we will go back to that because there?s a couple of other issues to put on the table so?/,PM
7,109,Grocery,How about the temperature?/,QP
7,110,Wine,What kinds of products are you selling?/,QS
7,111,Wine,I know you said you are going to be selling coffee but that gets kept on a warm plate so that is already at a good temperature and cookies that doesn?t really matter those come out of the oven and cool quickly anyway./,SB-R
7,112,Wine,What other kind of products are you going to be selling?,QS
7,113,Grocery,How about 75 degree?/,OS
7,114,Wine,That wasn?t my question but that?s ok./,MI-N
7,115,Wine,I was asking what kind of product you?ll be selling like what sort of items./,MI-N
7,116,Grocery,What do you how hot do you want?/,QP
7,117,Wine,That?s not my question./,MI-N
7,118,Grocery,Ok I want to set the degree for 75./,IP
7,119,Wine,Right but I want some more information from you about your product before we talk about the temperature./,QS
7,120,Grocery,Umm you want?/,MI-N
7,121,Wine,So for example if you are selling produce like fruits and vegetables and things then lower temperature is going to be better for you because it is going to preserve your produce./,MI-N
7,122,Grocery,"Ok cause I make the coffee and the cookie/,I want the temperature higher./",SB-R/IP
7,123,Wine,But coffee is going to be on a warm plate. It is always on a warm plate so temperature is irrelevant for coffee because it has its own container and for cookies they cool when they come out of the oven anyway/,SB-R
7,124,Wine,and actually warmer is going to raise our heating costs in the winter so that is going to be more expensive/,SB-R
7,125,Wine,and in the summer less people come in the store because it is going to be no cooler than outside/,SB-R
7,126,Grocery,Do you think temperature is a problem for you?/,QP
7,127,Wine,Yes it is because alcohol doesn?t taste good that warm. Alcohol needs to be kept cooler./,SB-R/IP
7,128,Grocery,"You know if we turn on the air conditioner,it will cost a lot of electric./",SB-R
7,129,Wine,"It will; however,if you?ve got customers walking by on the street and it?s warm out in the summer they come in, it?s cool inside they stay longer they buy more./",SB-R
7,130,Grocery,I don?t think so./,SB-R
7,131,Wine,I do./,SB-R
7,132,Wine,"If it?s a warm store I?d leave if it?s already warm outside; if it?s a cool store I can stay for a while and get cold and get comfortable,I?d stay longer./",SB-R
7,133,Grocery,How about winter?/,QS
7,134,Wine,"Well in winter,it?s going to keep our heating costs down to not be so warm/",SB-R
7,135,Wine,"and in winter you are wearing a winter coat anyway so you go into the store if it is too warm in the store in the winter you start to sweat you take your jacket off,you have to find somewhere to put it./",SB-R
7,136,Wine,"So actually,also I am from Minnesota I just don?t like warm. This is my own personal preference as well, I prefer cool, in warm, I don?t function./",SB-R
7,137,Grocery,"Ok,so you know for me, for coffee if it is out of the container it will decrease temperature./",SB-R
7,138,Wine,Well right but the coffee is going to be in the container until somebody buys the cup of coffee. That is how coffee is always sold./,SB-R
7,139,Grocery,So if your wine is refrigerated it is ok?/,QS
7,140,Wine,"Well wine generally is not kept in a refrigerator. Red wine should never be referigerated,it is served at room temperature. It just needs to be served at a lower room temperature/",SB-R
7,141,Grocery,OK I think?/,MI-N
7,142,Wine,I will have a refrigerator for some of the bottles of alcohol for example some white wines get chilled. SO there will be a refrigerator for white wines./,SB-R
7,143,Wine,But most of the time wine is sold off of a rack in the store and if it is kept too warm then it doesn?t taste good anymore and it starts to degrade the wine./,SB-R
7,144,Wine,"Also if you are selling other things,which I am assuming you are selling more than coffee and cookies because coffee and cookies doesn?t fit with wine?.then?/",SB-R
7,145,Grocery,"So ok,I want the temperature at 73 degree./",IP
7,146,Wine,And my wine is still going to melt./,SB-R

7,151,Wine,Put on a jacket. You can always put on more clothes there is only so much you can take off to be legal./,SB-R
7,152,Grocery,Do you think everyone will wear a jacket while he or she is working?/,SB-R
7,153,Wine,"I am fine with 65 degrees,that is where I keep my house at./",SB-R

7,162,Wine,What works for you?/,QP
7,163,Grocery,You know I must train the employee for my shop and buy some stuff from the abroad./,SB-R
7,164,Wine,"But you have to train employees but I thought right now you are in a larger space and you are moving to a smaller space. In that case you are going to have to cut employees,not train more./",SB-R
7,165,Grocery,I think we have no reason to open so soon./,SB-R
7,166,Wine,The earlier we open the more profits we get from business./,SB-R
7,167,Grocery,"Umm but we can?t get prepared everything,get everything prepared for opening./",SB-R
7,168,Wine,I?ll be ready by then./,SB-R
7,169,Grocery,You have been ready?/,QS

7,196,Grocery,"I can put the hour at 8:30 and close the shop 9:30,is that ok?/",CS
7,197,Wine,I am fine with that I don?t think it?s in the rules that we can do that. According to the rules that they gave us the shop can only be open 12 hours. Otherwise I am fine with that. I believe we only get 5 categories to operate with and they are all 12 hour increments./,OT
7,198,Wine,Yes./,MI-N
7,199,Wine,"Our options are 10:30 to 10:30,9:30 to 9:30, 8:30 to 8:30 and so on./",MI-N

7,206,Grocery,"You just told me,I think honesty is?./",Mineg
7,207,Wine,"I agree but in this case,I forgot some of my negotiating parameters./",MI-N
7,208,Grocery,So uh I think my stays is our?/,MI-N
7,209,Grocery,So everybody must be honest with me./,Mineg
7,210,Wine,And I was honest until I looked at my negotiating parameters. I hadn?t checked some of my facts properly when I made that offer and so?/,MI-N
7,211,Wine,well hold on./,MI-N
7,212,Wine,9:30 and September and we drop the temperature in the building 2 degrees./,OM
7,213,Grocery,Why?/,QS
7,214,Grocery,Now let?s be logical./,MI-neg
7,215,Wine,I am being logical. I am a scientist but again so are you./,MI-Neg
7,216,Grocery,Yeah so uh you just ask me if I wanted open at?in September you will agree 9:30. Just a minute ago./,MI-NEG
7,217,Wine,"You?re right I did and I pulled my offer. I took my offer back,this happens all the time in business, at least in this country. Until the offer is in writing, it is just negotiating back and forth. Car salesman do it all the time granted I shouldn?t use that as a good example but?/",MI-NEG
7,218,Grocery,Yeah I know so?/,MI-N
7,219,Wine,So 9:30 in September is fine with me as long as we drop the room temperature to 69 degrees./,OM

7,221,Wine,"I am being honest right now,that?s my offer./",MI-NEG

7,223,Wine,Ok well in that case we are at an impasse and I am not sure what we do in this case./,MI-NEG
7,224,Wine,We?re at an impasse and we?ve decided that we wouldn?t work very well together because she?s selling morning products and I?m selling evening products. So I think we would both like different business partners./,MI-NEg

9,3,Grocery,Alright.,MI-C
9,4,Grocery," It looks like we have five issues to discuss,and I dont know if you prefer doing them one at a time or doing them all together.",PO
9,5,Grocery," But I think we should start one at a time and go over every one of them again so thatI meancause one of us is bound to be unhappy with it,with at least one outcome.",PO
9,6,Grocery,"So I figure that way we can kind of minimize,you know, hard feelings and try to get to something that works for the both of us.",MIC
9,7,Grocery,Does that sound okay to you?,QM
9,8,Wine,Yeah.,MI-C
9,9,Grocery,Is there a specific one you want to start with?,P1
9,10,Wine,Can we start from the last one first?,P1
9,11,Wine,I dont know which one,MI-N
9,12,Grocery,I dont know if the last one for you is the last one for me.,MI-N
9,13,Wine,"Oh I see,ok.",MI-N
9,14,Wine,Likecan we start from the grand opening date?,P1
9,15,Grocery,Sure.,MI-C
9,16,Wine,Which do you prefer?,QP
9,17,Grocery,"I would prefer September 1st,",IP
9,18,Grocery,"because I think that its very important for us to start the store by looking really good and being completely ready for everybody,",SB-R
9,19,Grocery,"and having good customer service,",SB-R
9,20,Grocery,so I think that would be the best date.,IP
9,21,Wine,"For me,I think the early the better for us",IP
9,22,Wine," because like,everything is ready for us and we want to start early and make money.",SB-R
9,23,Wine,but maybe its not a big issue so we can talk about this,IR/SB-R
9,24,/Can you just hurry up a little bit and so,Grocery,"Sure,I think August 1st would be okay. Id be willing to do it then.",IP
9,25,/Can you just hurry up a little bit and so,Would August 1st be okay with you?,OS
9,26,Wine,"Oh yeah,okay.",RP
9,27,Grocery,So we can tentatively say that and we can adjust more.,PO
9,28,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
9,29,Grocery,"Another issue that we have is the renovation cost and for that,I would sugguest that we just/I mean it looks like the renovation cost in total is $30,000",

9,39,Wine,"we want to decorate the shop a little bit better,and so that we can attract more customers,",SB-R
9,40,/so thats very important for us,IR
9,41,/so thats very important for us,So can you think about that?,QM

9,43,Wine,"At least $25,000?",QP
9,44,Wine,"$25,000.00 ",IP
9,45,Wine," Actually the best for us is $30,000.",IP
9,46,Grocery,"So why dont we cut it in half and say $20,000?",OS
9,47,Wine,"$20,000how about 25?",OS
9,48,Wine,I prefer that.,IP
9,49,Wine,25 because I also think good decoration is good for you.,SB-R
9,50,Wine,So think about that. You know?,QM
9,51,Grocery,"I dont know,I think its more important to have good customer service than good decorations because I mean its a grocery store.",SB-R
9,52,Grocery,"Wine storereally,the wine itself looks good. You know?",SB-R
9,53,Grocery,But..,MI-N
9,54,Wine,"But sometimes looking is very important if some new customer,they dont know how your customer service and maybe from the looking, they will just come in and take a look, and you know?",SB-R
9,55,Wine,So I think thats very important,SB-R
9,56,Wine,and its just one time investment.,SB-R
9,57,Grocery,"Okay,25?",OS
9,58,Wine,"Okay,25, actually for me, the best is 30.",IP

9,60,Grocery,"For the time being,we can go over it again, alright?",PM
9,61,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
9,62,Grocery,I think floor space should be the easiest one,MI-N
9,63,Grocery,because we just need more space than you do.,SB-R
9,64,Grocery,"Its really that simple,but it should be relatively even because we dont want one store to completely overtake the other.",SB-R
9,65,Grocery,"So,we think that having 60% for us and 40% for you is fair.",OS
9,66,Wine,Thats excellent for me.,RP
9,67,Wine,I just need for presenting.,MI-N
9,68,Grocery,Okay?,QM
9,69,Grocery,That was easy!,MI-C

9,73,Grocery,Which one do you want to do first?,P1
9,74,Wine,Hours of operation.,P1
9,75,Grocery,"We do breakfast foods,so we want to do it as early as possible",SB-R/IP
9,76,Grocery,",and I realize that it can only be a 12 hour day.",SF

9,78,Wine,"I can understand your..for the breakfast you have to open early,but think about our situation.",ID-P
9,79,Wine,We will sell the wine in liquor..you know..I dont think people will buy the liquor or wine in the morning you know?,SB-R
9,80,Wine,"I think most people will buy it after 6:30,after they finish their work and they want to have wine or liquor in the home and just soits not a reasonable time for me.",SB-R
9,81,Grocery,"Well,I think that anything later than 7:30 would be gettingopening the store itself at 7:30, and for us, breakfast foods are out of the question, and that would be pretty much a dealbreaker for us",SB-R
9,82,Grocery,because we need to be able to sell those foods.,SB-R
9,83,Grocery,I think the 7:30 option will still give you people two and a half hours after they finish work and if theyre having a dinner party or whatever they still have time to go buy the wine and go still have their dinner parties.,SB-R
9,84,Grocery,I think that would be a fair cutoff  but I think anything later than thats going to be really really tough for us.,IP
9,85,Grocery,"I mean,theres really no good option.",MI-NEG
9,86,Wine,"I think most people just,maybe they come out and buy something like, beer, wine, maybe after the dinner and think about that.",SB-R
9,87,Wine,"Like,always, people finish their work at 5 oclock and maybe they need half and hour to drive home, so",SB-R
9,88,Grocery,I think it still gives them a solid two hours to buy the wine.,SB-R
9,89,Grocery,"Like I said,anything later than 7:30 in the morning, andI mean, people are done with breakfast, they are already at work.",SB-R
9,90,Grocery,"So I think that thats you know,I think this ones really important for us.",IR

9,92,Wine,"I guess for your convenience its the best part,so okay we can just dohow about like 8:30?",PC/OS
9,93,8:30 am to 8:30pm?,,You think its not reasonable for you?,QM
9,94,Grocery,I think thats too late for breakfast.,RN
9,95,Grocery,I mean I think that Id be losing more business than you would be gaining by getting an additional hour.,SB-R
9,96,Grocery,"Is that,you know, theres way more people I think that eat breakfast between 7:30 and 8:30 than one that wants to buy alcohol between 7:30 and 8:30, you know what Im saying?",SB-R
9,97,Grocery,Sowell we can leave that unresolved if you want for awhile and deal with the temperature.,PM
9,98,Grocery,"I mean,I dont want to end on a deadlock.",MI-N
9,99,Wine,How about the temperature?,QP
9,100,Grocery,"For us,the ideal temperature is 73 degrees,",IP
9,101,Grocery,because thatswe have a lot of fresh fruits and so thats the ideal.,SB-R
9,102,Wine,73?!,RN
9,103,Grocery,Thats right.,MI-N
9,104,Wine,"You know for the wine,the best degree is 65 degrees.",IP

9,107,Grocery,I dont know if thats in your renovation cost but thats really cold.,SB-R
9,108,Grocery,65 is really cold.,SB-R
9,109,Grocery,"I mean,I think..If you dont want to buy fridges, we have to kind of just cut it in half because you know and just say its the middle one, 69 degrees.",PC
9,110,Wine,69 degrees?,QM
9,111,Grocery,And that way its okay for you and its okay for me andyou know?,MIC
9,112,Wine,"Yeah,maybe.",MI-N
9,113,Wine,"So,69, yeah, but I have to think about the quality if I increase the temperature. The quality of the wine will decrease and I will lose a lot of the customers.",SB-R
9,114,Wine,Okay,MI-N
9,115,Grocery,"Yeah but at the same time,if the temperatures too low then our fruits and vegetables and fresh foods and stuff are just not going to be happy in the environment.",SB-R
9,116,Wine,"I think like,fruit and breakfast, youd still like maybe 67 degrees is fine?",OS
9,117,Wine," For you know,you still need some low temperature to keep these foods fresh, some you know, raw materials. Just for the people you know, think about the food.",SB-R

9,119,Wine,Im sorry? 67?,QM

9,121,Wine,"Okaymaybe,yeah!",RP
9,122,Wine,"But in this case,how about 65 so you can just open 7:30am to 7:30pm.",OM
9,123,Grocery,"65 I think is going to be an issue because its really cold,its really cold.",SB-R

11,6,Grocery,Well I was thinking September 1st would be the best for me.,IP
11,7,Wine,September?,QM
11,8,Wine,"Okay,okay.",MIN

11,12,Wine,"You mean hours?/ To me,as later as you can,you know,",QM/ IP

11,15,Grocery,," So I was trying to think about what,a business person, so they work from like 9 to 5.",SBR
11,16,Wine,Do you also serve dinner or?,QS

11,18,Grocery,"So maybe if would be nice for me to stay open a little bit around dinner time also,",SBR
11,19,Grocery,but Id definitely like a little bit of time before 9 oclock so they can go in and get the breakfast.,IP
11,20,Wine,I think the earliest I can is 8:30.,IP
11,21,Wine,I cannot go any earlier than that.,IB

11,25,Grocery,Okay.,MIN
11,26,Wine,"For the renovation,I cant. I need that money,",SBR
11,27,Wine,"so since $30,000 is okay?",OS
11,28,Grocery,Lets talk about the other thing,PM
11,29,Grocery,"because the renovationbecause for me,like the cost of how much I can spend at the beginning depnds on how much my monthly cost is going to be.",PP
11,30,Wine,"But I think a good environment also benefits for you,right?",SBR
11,31,Grocery,"Right,so what were you thinking about temperature and floor space?",QP
11,32,Wine,"Actually,I like it as, I mean, lower as it can because the wine, especially for the beers and something, as cooler as it can.",IP/SBR
11,33,Grocery,"Right,also, I will be able to spend more money to help you buy coolers, like referidgerator units if we can keep the temperature higher.",SBR

11,35,Grocery,"Its dry food,and then if we keep the temperature cooler, I have to pay more per month for air conditioning.",SBR
11,36,Wine,"Yeah,but do you have some space for the customer to have some, do you have at your place?",SBR
11,37,Wine,"So I think cold place is better for them,right?",SBR
11,38,Grocery,But what temperature is your house?,SBR
11,39,Grocery,Mine is like 75 or like low 70sthats whats likeyou know?,SBR

11,41,Wine,When you eat something you always add ice to your drinking.,SBR
11,42,Wine,"So I think I mean,lower is better for you.",SBR

11,44,Grocery,"If I spend more per month on air conditioning,I can afford less on the renovation cost,",PP
11,45,Grocery,because I only have a certain amount of money.,SBR
11,46,Grocery,"So if I have to pay more every month,that kind of decreases, like what I can pay at the start.",SBR
11,47,Grocery,"So I can pay more renovation,so I was thinking of 10,000.",IP
11,48,Wine,I cant do it.,RN
11,49,Grocery,"Okay,so lets say if we can raise the temperature, I can spend an extra 10,000 to buy more referidgeration units, like coolers and nice display cases.",SBR

12,17,Wine,We have a time limit here,OT

12,34,Wine,So what is your best time?,QP
12,35,Grocery,"Well,the earlier the better.",IP
12,36,Wine,The earlier the better?,QM
12,37,Wine,What is your best time?,QP
12,38,Grocery,"Well,well, 10:30 is definitely a little late for me I think.",IP
12,39,Wine,"In my opinion,this is just a personal opinion. The freshness of the baker is the most important thing in the grocery store, and I think..Im not sure when I usually bring the grocery.",SBR
12,40,Grocery,"It probably depends on the type of item,but I think the reason why I would like to start earlier is the fact that I sell coffee and some breakfast items that Im hoping particularly, in Dupont Circle is an area where many young professionals live, hopefully in their way to work I can get some business from them.",SBR
12,41,Grocery,"So,of course, deliveries would be very early in the morning before traffic would start. /But you know",SBR/MI-N

12,45,Grocery," So,what would you say to..well, would 9:30 be completely out of the question or is that something",OS

12,65,Wine,I want to spend as much as we,IP
12,66,Grocery,Okay.,MIN
12,67,Grocery,"So as much as possible,what does that mean for you in terms of amounts?",QP

12,71,Wine,"40,40,just 40.",OS
12,72,Grocery,40thats still I think thats a little high for you know,IP
12,73,Grocery,"maybe in the wine business its important to have that kind of flashy imageyou know. People in the grocery business maybe a little less concerned about that,so.",SBR
12,74,Grocery,"I mean,of course, the renovation cost is something that you have to spend first and worry more about being able to recoop the cost, so.",SBR
12,75,Grocery,Do you still feel comfortable that amount of money?,QM
12,76,Wine,"Yeah,I think that, I mean thatthis will pay off in the long run so yeah",SBR
12,77,Wine,can I ask you a question?,QM
12,78,Wine,What is the most important issue in this negotiation?,QR

12,80,Grocery,"Well,I think anyone going into any type of negotiation, even if they dont admit it, their number 1 priority is getting what they want.",MI-NEG
12,81,Grocery,"But at the same time,if we are sharing a space, its good to maybe not be friends but at least co-exist peacefully, soI think finding a reasonable compromise would be important.",PC

12,85,Wine,So what is the most important?,QR
12,86,Grocery,"I would say probably for me,I wouldhmm well weve already discussed the issue but I still think the hours of operation are the mostsince I just..that timing being important.",IR
12,87,Wine,What is your best time?,QP
12,88,Grocery,I think my best time would be from 6:30.,IP
12,89,Wine,6:30?!,RN
12,90,Grocery,Given that fact that many people in Washington start work early and you knowI would hope to do a good breakfast business and my fear is that definitely 10:30 is almost lunch time for some people.,SBR
12,91,Grocery,"So,the earlier the better so I think I would be willingthinking that I can increase my business by opening more early.",SBR
12,92,Grocery,That I would be willing to spend a little more and then I would hope for renovation costs.,PP
12,93,Wine,"As you know,in the alcohol business, the closing at 6:30 in the evening is too early.",SBR
12,94,Grocery,"Yeah,I understand that.",MIC
12,95,Wine,"If I accept the 6:30,is your time, your business hours, can you accept the offer of the decoration?",OM
12,96,Grocery,"I would be willing towell of course,according to our chart, the top amount is $30,000, right?",QP
12,97,Grocery,And you would like to spend that much or more.,IN-N
12,98,Wine,"Yes,youre right.",IP
12,99,Grocery,"I think I would be willing towould $25,000 be unreasonable for you?",OS
12,100,Wine,"$25,000 and 6am?",OM
12,101,Grocery,"Well,6:30 would be my preferred time,",IP
12,102,Grocery,"but as Ive said,I think that the bulk of my business would be early, so you know, I might even be persuaded to meet your renovation cost a month if you would be willing to",SBR
12,103,Grocery,"butsince it seems that definitely for us,the days are switched where your business is more at the end of the day and my business is at the end of the day,",SBR
12,104,Grocery,so I dont want to be completely inflexible so would 7:30 be a more reasonable?,OS
12,105,Wine,"It is a little bit more reasonable,but so youll accept the $25,000?",OS
12,106,Grocery,And opening at 7:30.,OS
12,107,Grocery,Is that somewhat reasonable for you or?,QM

12,109,Wine,I cant say right now if this is acceptable or not.,MIN
12,110,Wine,"But still,I think $25,000 is reasonable.",IP

12,112,Wine,Can I talk about hours of operation later?,PM
12,113,Grocery,"We can yeah,we can come back to that, yeah.",PM
12,114,Wine,This is a little bit.,MIN
12,115,Grocery,"Okay,so we have the three other issues to discuss, the floor space, the temperature, and the opening day.",PO
12,116,Wine,Which do you think you would like to discuss next?,QM
12,117,Grocery,What about the temperature?,P1
12,118,Grocery,"And of course,the temperature impacts also",MIN
12,119,Grocery," because something at warmer temperature is cheaper because its less cooling cost,but lower temperature",SBR
12,120,Wine,What about the freshness?,SBR
12,121,Wine,"Usually,keeping the",MI-N
12,122,Grocery,"My produce,things like that?",SBR

12,124,Grocery,"I think the most of my items dont need it too cold,",SBR
12,125,Grocery,"and given the fact that were thinking of a higher renovation cost,covered over the year",PP
12,126,Wine,What do you sell?,QS
12,127,Grocery,"As Ive said,its more breads and things that do not necessarily, at least the room temperature doesnt have to be very very cold.",SBR
12,128,Grocery,"Particularly these days,I think the cooling and heating costs are much higher than usual because of oil prices and those types of things.",SBR

12,130,Grocery,Okay.,MIN
12,131,Wine,"If then,the electricity cost is",SBR
12,132,Grocery,You think thats a little higher thanyeah.,MIN
12,133,Grocery,"But of course,even  keeping it at 65 degrees in the shop is not cold enough for a wine to be cold right?",SBR
12,134,Grocery,Sowhat temperature do you think you would be the ultimate for your?,QP
12,135,Wine,69 is acceptable but can I treat this problem with another problem?,PX
12,136,Grocery,"Okay,sure sure.",MIC
12,137,Wine,"Floor space,how much space do you need?",QP
12,138,Grocery," Well,I think a little more than half would be the ultimate for me.",IP
12,139,Wine,Oh really.,MIN
12,140,Wine,So how much percent?,QP
12,141,Grocery,Well the ultimate for me would be 60%.,IP
12,142,Wine,60%?,QM
12,143,Wine,So that means you want to use 60% of..,MIN
12,144,Grocery,Of the floor space.,MIN

12,146,Grocery," Okay,lets agree on 60%, very good.",MIC
12,147,Grocery,Thats one item that,MIN
12,148,Wine,So youre going to use 60% of that space and 40% of the space.,MIN
12,149,Grocery,"Is that good for you because I think my items require a little more space than your items but not significantly,so.",SBR
12,150,Grocery,But how about the grand opening date? What are you thinking?,QP
12,151,Grocery,Wine,"The earlier the better,",IP
12,152,Grocery,but I dont care too much about this thing.,IR
12,153,Grocery,"Okay,yeah in my case actually, I think that the being able tosince Im dealing with imported foods and some sort of specialty items, I think its important to find some people to work for me who are understandable.",SBR
12,154,Wine,You need time for practice?,QS
12,155,Grocery," Maybe a little bit of time to find somebody whos skillful and that kind of thing,so you said around July would be?",SBR
12,156,Grocery,When would you prefer to start?,QP

12,158,Wine,Is it easy for okay to you?,OS
12,159,Grocery,"A little later is better for me,actually since its already giving later.",IP

12,161,Wine,"If I accept the September or August,would you be flexible on opening time?",PP
12,162,Grocery,The time?,QM
12,163,Grocery,I actually prefer to be flexible about the temperature.,IR
12,164,Wine,The temperature?!,QM
12,165,Grocery,"Earlier is still better for me,I think.",IP
12,166,Grocery,"So,how about..well you would prefer to keep it around 69 degrees, you think would be acceptable?",OS
12,167,Wine,69?,QM
12,168,Wine,67?,QM
12,169,Grocery,67?,OS
12,170,Wine,"If you accept 67,Im going to..Ill",PX
12,171,Grocery,"Okay,so, I think 67 degrees is reasonable but I think that would also be impacted by the grand opening date.",PP
12,172,Wine,Oh really.,MIN
12,173,Grocery,Yeah,MIN
12,174,Wine,Oh okay.,MIN
12,175,Wine,What is your?,QP
12,176,Grocery,"Well,later the better but I think I wouldif you were able to open at 6:30 in the morning, I think that maybe starting in August would be okay.",OM
12,177,Grocery,Starting in July would I guess be okay.,OM
12,178,Wine,You said 6:30?,QM
12,179,Grocery,"If you agree to earlier hours,Im agreeable to starting in the middle of summer for the starting day.",PP
12,180,Wine,So when is your date you want to start?,QP

12,182,Wine,July?,QM
12,183,Wine,I canwell probably fix the hours?,PP

13,7,Grocery,"So,do you want to start on the hours of operation?",P1
13,8,Grocery,Is it okay to ask you your priority of the hours of operation?,QP
13,9,Wine,"Yeah,that would be great.",MIC
13,10,Wine,"For us,the later the hours, the better",IP
13,11,Wine,"because more people tend to purchase their wine later in the day as opposed to you know,when theyre headed to a party or going out to dinner,",SBR
13,12,Wine,"and also I feel like you know,both of our products are kind of luxury items, not necessarily, necessities and so many people work 9 to 5 jobs so I feel like well get better sales if were open late at night.",SBR
13,13,Wine,So I really prefer to have later hours.,IP

13,17,Grocery,Is it okay?,QM
13,18,Wine,"Right,yeah.",MIN
13,19,Wine,Im just thinking how we canif we couldTheres so many different context of.like I dont know if we have the same cash registers?,QM
13,20,Wine,I guess we would have separate cash registers.,MIN
13,21,Wine," Because most of our sales I feel would come after 5 at night,so.",SBR
13,22,Wine,"And at that point,I feel that a lot of your products could be purchased in addition to our wine products when people are going out on the town or out to a party, or even having their own dinner parties or going home from work when theyre relaxed and thinking about it.",SBR
13,23,Grocery,Is there any possibilities to make it earlier?,QM
13,24,Wine,What hours are you thinking?,QP
13,25,Grocery,"Actually,I was thinking like 7:30am to 7:30pm.",IP
13,26,Wine,We would really prefer 10:30am to 10:30pm,IP
13,27,Wine,"because if we close at 7:30,we really feel like we only have two and a half hours of sale time.",SBR
13,28,Grocery,"Yeah but if we start at 10:30,then at that time, I dont think that people need breakfast,",SBR
13,29,Grocery,so maybe we should.how about8:30?,OS
13,30,Wine,What about 9:30?,OS
13,31,Grocery,"Well,I still think you knowits too late, 8:30 in the morning",SBR
13,32,Grocery,do you want to skip to another one?,PM
13,33,Wine,We can come back.,PM
13,34,Wine,"We can go to renovation costs. Um,or we can go to...I guess renovation costs is good.",P1
13,35,Wine," I guess my feeling is that I feel that the better our store looks inside and out,the more likely the chances of the more customers will draw in.",SBR
13,36,Wine,"We both have specialty,high-level items that we sell so we really need to project an image of cleanliness.",SBR
13,37,Wine,"Especially more so cleanliness for food and wine products if people are going to be eating,to show that we follow standards.",SBR
13,38,Wine,"Dupont Circle,especially where everybody is so trendy and coming and going and I think were going to be able to prosper in this area and our return on our investment will be high.",SBR
13,39,Wine,We can put in the renovation initially.,SBR
13,40,Wine,Its easier to renovate and make all the changes right away before we actually opened up than to try to continue to renovate once were open.,SBR
13,41,Grocery,Maybe we should reduce the cost in the beginning?,QM
13,42,Wine,"Well,I feel like theres not going to bethis is going to be the be-all if we make it or not",SBR
13,43,Wine,"because if once were open and we get a client-base,trying to close down again to further renovate or update the building will make our businesses suffer.",SBR
13,44,Grocery,I understand but what if you spent that much money on renovation but it didnt get back?,SBR
13,45,Grocery,Sometimes people start a business with little bit of money and,SBR
13,46,Wine,"I just feel that the more you put in,the more you put out.",SBR
13,47,Grocery,Right.,MIN
13,48,Grocery,So whats your budget?,QP
13,49,Wine,"This is one of the areas where I do kind of feel strongly about,/ I really feel that 30,000 be appropriate,",IR/ IP
13,50,Wine," especially because I mean,Dupont Circles an area where theres so many other specialty stores that were going to have quite a bit of competition and if we go in with looking the way it currently is, I dont think well be able to attract the clientele that frequents the area.",SBR
13,51,Wine,Theyre just not going to take us seriously.,SBR
13,52,Grocery,"I think $30,000 is too much for me,",IP
13,53,Grocery,and especially I dont think we dont need to have like a fancy store to sell the grocery.,SBR
13,54,Wine,"But were both specialty items,were not just a grocery store.",SBR
13,55,Wine,"Because were going to be doing a new venture with wine and bread together withYou know,",SBR
13,56,Wine,"and you know,youre an Upper Crust, youre not Lower Crust you know, value market.",SBR
13,57,Wine,Were both fine retailers.,SBR
13,58,Wine,I think we really need to project that image or were not going to be able to compete.,SBR
13,59,Wine,Its very difficult for me too.,SBR
13,60,Grocery,"Actually,I dont have that much budget you know?",SBR
13,61,Grocery," I prefer to spend the money on the product quality,the quality of the product.",SBR
13,62,Grocery,Is it necessary to spend that much money on renovation?,QS
13,63,Wine,I think the renovation is something where a little loan could be taken out,SBR
13,64,Wine,"and I think in return,investment, I  know from our end and our experience that the return in investment is sure to be high the more we put in initially,",SBR
13,65,Wine,because this initial image is..its going to cost us more to revamp an image if its not you know high quality than it is to start over.,SBR
13,66,Grocery,"Yeah,I know first impression is important.",MIC
13,67,Wine,"I understand,I mean, you know, were going to have to take out a loan.",SBR
13,68,Wine,"Our budget is limited butI just feel thatI mean were both,you know, the best in our industries, so I think were not taking that large of a gamble if we do the costly renovation in the beginning,",SBR
13,69,Wine,"and once we put that money down,you know, itll be better to have that as initial high quality and then well have less, like, you know, unexpected expenses come when things go wrong that we didnt expect to start with.",SBR
13,70,Grocery,"How about we dont put that much money in the beginning,maybe reduce the cost, I mean, dont put like 30,000 or higher in the beginning.",SBR
13,71,Grocery," Maybe we can you know,like $15,000 in the beginning, and after that when we earn some money",OS
13,72,Wine,I dont think that theres anyway that we canwe have to shut our stores down to do renovations and were going to have to lose money.,SBR
13,73,Wine,"So I think this is a one-time shot,a one-time chance to make our image known.",SBR
13,74,Wine,And I feel like I have room to maneuver in other areas but this is one of the areas thats really important for us.,IR
13,75,Grocery,I dont think that we can make an agreement on this issue.,ID-N
13,76,Grocery,"Yeahwhat if we combined these two issues together,like.",PP
13,77,Wine,"Well lets talk about the other issues first,and well have more wiggle room with the other issues, so we can come to agreement on something else first.",PM
13,78,Grocery,Okay.,MIN
13,79,Wine,At least we understand each others stance on those two.,MIC
13,80,Wine,"What about,do you want to go to grand opening date?",P1
13,81,Grocery,Sure.,MIN
13,82,Wine,"I guess for us,we have a lot of products that are ready and most of it is in storage currently, so were ready to go in selling the products.",SBR
13,83,Wine,"So the sooner we have the grand opening,the better it would be for us.",IP

16,120,Grocery,"Because thats thats cut onif you set the temperature lower,uh..higher, we can save on the electricities.",SB-R

16,145,Grocery,Maybe you can follow the uhcause you know we uhwe put renovation and operation hour together.,PP

16,147,Grocery,Do you prefer to havehowwhats your position on the floor space?,QP
16,148,Wine,"I mean,you know, to me, the more floor space",IP
16,149,Grocery,Its a wine store.,SF
16,150,Wine,Whats that?,QM
16,151,Grocery,"Its a wine store,right?",QS
16,152,Wine,"It is a wine store,but still, you know, more store space means you know, I can put more products out there, which means I can sell more.",SB-R
16,153,Grocery,Youre right.,MI-C
16,154,Wine,"I mean,I came in here thinking 50% would be as lowest as I would want to go.",SB-R
16,155,Wine,Would you be willinghow about this?,MI-N
16,156,Wine,"I would be willing to take 40% of the store,you know, I would give you your extra floor space, if maybe we go up a little higher, or go a little lower for me on temperature.",PP
16,157,Grocery,How low will that be?,QP
16,158,Grocery,You just said 40% now on the space.,MI-N
16,159,Wine,Right.,MI-N
16,160,Grocery,"With that,how low you will go for the temperature?",QP
16,161,Wine,How about 67?,OS
16,162,Grocery,67,MI-N
16,163,Grocery,That will be a problem because that will cost my store a lot of electricity.,SB-R
16,164,Wine,I see.,MI-N
16,165,Grocery,"Although,you wanna60% of the space.",MI-N
16,166,Wine,"No,I want 40.",IP
16,167,Grocery,Oh yeah.,MI-N
16,168,Wine,"I only want 40,you would get 60.",IP
16,169,Grocery,We have 60% of the space.,MI-N
16,170,Grocery,Its really fair that we cut our electricity based on the space.,CS
16,171,Grocery,So I will pay like a 60% electricity.,CS
16,172,Grocery,And if thats like uh seventyyou said 67 degrees  That will be too low.,IP
16,173,Wine,Too low for you.,IN-N
16,174,Grocery,Too low for me.,MI-N
16,175,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
16,176,Wine,"Cause you see,what Im trying to do here, Im saying I came in here thinking I would like 50% of the floor space.",SBR
16,177,Wine,"And Im saying Im willing to take only 40% instead in return for,you know maybe a concession from you on making the temperature a little bit lower.",PP
16,178,Grocery,Mmm temperature is 67.,MI-N
16,179,Grocery,"If you can take one,two degrees higher, that would be ideal.",IP
16,180,Grocery,I can take it definitely.,MI-N
16,181,Wine,"Oh,that doesnt seem good for me/ because two degrees higher puts us at the middle.",RN/SB-R
16,182,Wine,"You know,the middle of the five options?",QM
16,183,Wine,Temperature?,QM
16,184,Wine,So Im giving you the middle here and Im still taking hit over here on the floor space.,RT
16,185,Grocery,"Is that the point,one issue? We are actually talking about the cost, or the profitability to our store.",SBR
16,186,Grocery,,Two degrees is a really big deal for the wine store?,SB-R/SB-R
16,187,Since you only have 40% of the store space. And thats really a small percentage from the electricity bill,," And two degrees I spend on it,temperature will not have that huge effect as, to me right?",SB-R
16,188,Since you only have 40% of the store space. And thats really a small percentage from the electricity bill,Ill pay more on electricity.,SB-R
16,189,Wine,"I mean,you know.",MI-N
16,190,Wine,"Another ten percent of the store isnt that much either,really.",SB-R
16,191,Grocery,"Ah,yeah right.",MI-C
16,192,Grocery,"Youit matters to you than 10% to me on the space,floor space.",MI-N
16,193,Grocery," Probably we can go back to talklets stay here,lets say.",P1
16,194,Grocery,"If you have 40% of the store space,and 67 degrees, you can definitely take it?",OM
16,195,Wine,Yes.,RP
16,196,Grocery,"And I can take it if thats 40,40% to you, and 69 degrees.",OM
16,197,Grocery,So I can definitely take it.,RP
16,198,Wine,"Okay,thats two options, is what youre saying.",MI-N
16,199,Wine,Alright.,MI-N
16,200,Grocery,"So weand um,you said its very possible you can take 8:30 on operation time and $20,000 dollars for the renovation.",OM
16,201,Wine,True.,MI-N
16,202,Wine,"That would be okay,I mean you know, in the back of my head Im thinking that I agreed to September 1, so I still feel that you know, somewhere in here, if we were to take the middle of the road,",RT
16,203,Wine,"8:30 opening and $20,000,if we were to take that, I would insist on 40% of the floor space for me and 67 degrees.",OM
16,204,Grocery,"How about II can increase the renovation cost to $25,000. From $20,000 to $25,000. And you yield 2 degrees on the temperature to me,from 69 tofrom 67 to 69. And we keep the other two options as it is.",OM
16,205,Wine,"So the total agreement would be open at 8:30,$25,000 for renovation, 40% floor space for me, 60% for you",MI-N
16,206,Grocery,And degree will be 69.,MI-N
16,207,Wine,69 degrees and September 1.,MI-N
16,208,Grocery,Yes.,MI-N
16,209,Wine,"Okay,deal.",RP
16,210,Wine,Great.,MI-C
16,211,Wine," Thats no time,uh, 10 minutes?",PT
16,212,Grocery,So lets repeat to make sure we get everything correct.,MI-N
16,213,Grocery,"8:30 to 8:30 operation time,$25,000 renovation cost, and 60% floor space for me.",MI-N
16,214,Wine,40% for me.,MI-N

17,35,Grocery,"But,then Benduccis kind of fussy about that but he wants to go for labor day and I said, okay thatll work. So we tried to do that. ",SBR

17,56,Grocery,"A little bit,the buildings great so it doesnt need that much but you know, we can do signage.",IP
17,57,Wine,"I think we have to show some specialty,I mean to others, right?",SBR
17,58,Grocery,Absolutely.,MIC
17,59,Wine,"When people drive or walk around Dupont Circle,they can, I mean, see all the shops, I mean.",SBR
17,60,Grocery,"You know,its going to be mostly foot traffic because you cant park down there for anything.",SBR
17,61,Wine,But you know there is a lot of walkers.,SBR
17,62,Grocery,"Yeah,absolutely.",MIN
17,63,Grocery,Thats our main target.,SBR
17,64,Grocery,"Those folks that are there early and by 6:30,7, theyre gone.",SBR

17,69,Wine,"Well,you know, I mean in Dupont Circle, there are a  lots of people there and a lot of people live there, so I mean, someday they must have party or no party, or even want to drink something, maybe coke or wine, stuff like that, so I think I mean",SBR
17,70,Grocery,"We dont want to become one of the bag stores now,were selling high quality specialty stuff. We want people to come in and buy it, take home with it.",SBR
17,71,Wine,"Yes,so we also want to, I mean,were very convenient to customers.",SBR
17,72,Grocery,"Its the earlybirds that are going to be our best shoppers because theyre coming in just on their way to work,and those, those joggers you  know?.",SBR
17,73,Wine,"No,I dont think so.",MI-NEG
17,74,Wine," I think I mean,I mean, most of the parties or like dinner, they are there in the evening right?",SBR
17,75,Grocery,"In the evening,theyre getting their stuff at the restaurant.",SBR
17,76,Wine,"No,not everybody goes to restaurant right?",SBR
17,77,Wine,"Not for everybody,not most of the time, they are still eating at home, not really, at restaurant .",SBR

17,80,Grocery,"Thats all thats going to be there in the evening,that and the bums. Were not going to deal with bums, Id hope.",SBR
17,81,Grocery,We probably need a little bit of security at the front door sometimes there.,SBR
17,82,Grocery,"But really,the earlier we open, the better off we are",IP
17,83,Grocery,and I know Benducci says its gotta be 12 hours so I think we can make that work.,MIC
17,84,Wine,"Well,how early do you want?",QP
17,85,Grocery,"You know,I would prefer 5.",IP
17,86,Wine,5am?!,RN
17,87,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN
17,88,Wine,NO.,RN
17,89,Grocery,"Cause thats when the first people get off the metro,and theyre on their way to work and they got to pick up something quick before they get into work. Have all the groceries, have the newspapers, and couple bottles there that they might need for party at work in the afternoon.",SBR
17,90,Grocery,So theres a lot of opportunities there to reach the early crowd and the late crowd by being open somewhat5 to 6.,SBR
17,91,Wine,"I just think,I mean, because I mean, people coming from the metro, I mean, in the metro station, there are already a lot of other grocery store, from small one.",SBR
17,92,Wine," I mean,they already have newspapers, they already have breakfast so",SBR
17,93,Grocery,"Well,the newspapers there but were going to carry out-of-town papers too and that helps.",SBR
17,94,Wine,"Well,we also have that.",SBR
17,95,Wine,"Well have New York times,we also have Wall Street Journal, so I dont think I mean, we should open so early, right?",SBR
17,96,Grocery,"Well if at 5am if they see our shop,see they can get everything at our place.",SBR
17,97,Wine,"Most of them get everything in,I mean, just nearby the metro station.",SBR
17,98,Grocery,"Yeah but its scattered around; you get the paper out of the box and you get the sandwich at the deli,and its sort of separated. Im trying to set up a one-stop shop so they can get everything at our place.",SBR
17,99,Wine,But do you think 5am too early,SBR
17,100,Wine,"because I have a guy who do the statistics. He said actually,the rush hour, the rush hour is starting from 8 oclock, actually.",SBR
17,101,Wine,It means,MIN
17,102,Grocery,"NO,people get there at 6 to just get a parking place.",SBR
17,103,Grocery,They start work at 8 so they got to be in their little offices by then.,SBR

17,107,Grocery,"No,theres lot of twerps but were looking for the working bees.",SBR
17,108,Wine,You know what? I mean working bees.,SBR
17,109,Wine,They probably do not really really care about the.,SBR
17,110,Grocery,"No,theyre the ones thatre going to be coming in buying little candy bars and stuff, a bottle of wine for the",SBR
17,111,Wine,"But they can buy them nearby the metro station,not really need to go to the grocery store to buy it, right?",SBR
17,112,Wine," Since youre a very big one,I mean, people will have to spend the time to walking and finding what they want.",SBR
17,113,Grocery,Well we got to..we got to be proactive about this.,SBR
17,114,Grocery,Were going to be premier store on the circle.,SBR
17,115,Grocery,"We got to be be the place where people go,we cant say",SBR
17,116,Wine,"I think we should targeton the people who come back home,not people who go to work.",SBR
17,117,Wine,"When people come back home,I mean, they are very free so they have, have enough time to select what kind of things they want to buy.",SBR
17,118,Wine,"I think this maybe better for you,I mean, every people have to eat so they go to your grocery store to buy bread, buy drink, to buy other things for their dinner and maybe they can also, I mean, wine or other liquors from ourfrom my store.",SBR
17,119,Wine,"So I just think,I mean",MIN
17,120,Grocery,Well were going to share a check out arent we?,QM
17,121,Wine,Yes.,MIN
17,122,Grocery,So its our store.,MIC
17,123,Grocery,We gotta be able to compromise.,PC
17,124,Wine,"Yes,yes, we have to cooperate right?",MIC
17,125,Grocery,How about 7?,OS
17,126,Grocery,That would work.,MIN
17,127,Grocery,We miss some of the early traffic but we get some of the later traffic. I think that would work for both of us.,SBR
17,128,Grocery,I know that the guys that work for me now dont want to start any earlier than 7. I have to wake them up sometimes and drag them out to get to work.,SBR
17,129,Wine,You know what?,MIN
17,130,Wine,"We should target on the people who come back home,/ so, so in this way I think 7 is also too early.",SBR/ IP
17,131,Wine," I will prefer like,9 oclock or something like that.",IP
17,132,Grocery,9?!,RN 
17,133,Grocery,Were skipping half the traffic down there if we dont open until 9.,SBR
17,134,Wine,"No,because, I mean, because my target, our target is focused on the people who come back home, people, I mean like housewife who stay at home, I mean, they dont want to get up so early right?",SBR
17,135,Grocery,There are no housewives in that neighborhood!,SBR
17,136,Wine,"No,I think its.its a nice place so a lot of people live there, so there must be housewives, other people there, so I meanThey dont need to get up so early right?",SBR
17,137,Grocery,"Ive seen the joggers come through at 5,its an amazing group! Those guys on the bicycles too, especially.",SBR
17,138,Grocery,They like to come in for snacks.,SBR
17,139,Grocery,"Theyre some of the quality buyers of liquor too,so.",SBR
17,140,Grocery,Theyre the folks that we ought to be concerned about.,SBR
17,141,Wine,"Well,thats a problem.",MI-NEG
17,142,Wine,"The joggers and the bicyclers,theyre on the street",SBR
17,143,Wine,Theyre usually do not really like to go into the store to walk around to find what they want,SBR
17,144,Grocery,"Well if we had a bike rack in the front,theyll feel better about it, cause you know, these guys are in their ..theyre bike messengers and theyre all over town but they congregate in Dupont for a raeson, because the ambiance there, and we want to be part of that and we want to reach them.",SBR
17,145,Wine,So you still think 7 is good?,QM
17,146,Grocery,I think 7 would be perfect.,IP
17,147,Grocery,"I would prefer 5 but 7 would reach both clientele,the ones that are there after work, on their way home, and well still reach some of the early traffic.",SBR
17,148,Wine,You know what?,MIN
17,149,Wine,"Because my shopmost of the stuff is wine,7 oclock is not really practical for me",SBR
17,150,Wine,because nobody will get up so early to buy wine right?,SBR
17,151,Grocery,It would be great if I can start at 5 and you can close at 9 but Benducci wont let us.,ID-N
17,152,Wine,"So,I think I mean, most of the people, I mean, buy food but they come back home no really buy food when they go to work, so I think your target should mostly focus on the people who come back.",SBR
17,153,Wine,So I think its better to have a late time instead of early time.,SBR
17,154,Grocery,I think a compromise is needed here because we need to reach a little bit of both of them.,PC
17,155,Grocery,I dont think there is,MIN
17,156,Wine,"And also I think there are lots of I mean,small groceries there, and people can very easily to get newspapers, get breakfast, so I do not really think people will, I mean, would like to going to your big store to find what they want.",SBR
17,157,Grocery,"Its not that big,its a specialty store afterall in Dupont, nothing big. Hopefully its just the right store, convenient.",SBR
17,158,Grocery,The Giant in Greenbelt is so big people got lost there and starved to death.,SBR
17,159,Wine,I dont want the same thing happen in your store right?,SBR
17,160,Grocery,This is going to be just the right size for people to come in and feel comfortable.,SBR
17,161,Wine,"So I mean,I saw a lot of people they buy food when they come back home, so why not start late and close late?",SBR
17,162,Grocery,"Well,because were going to miss the clientele.",SBR
17,163,Grocery,I think a good compromise around 7:30,OS

22,57,Grocery,Uh huh.,MI-N
22,58,Wine,So that comes down to floor space.,P1
22,59,Grocery,Floor space.,MI-N
22,60,Wine,How much floor space do you want?,QP
22,61,Grocery,Well according to the chart I would say 60 percent but I would,IP
22,62,Wine,Beautiful!,RP
22,63,Grocery,Really?,QM
22,64,Wine,"If you want 60 percent,40 percent is what I want.",OS
22,65,Grocery,"Thats great,thats great.",MIC
22,66,Wine,"Okay good,so we have 3 of them solved.",PO
22,67,Grocery,Right.,MI-N
22,68,Wine,That comes back to renovation costs.,P1
22,69,Grocery,Yes.,MI-N
22,70,Wine,"Renovation cost is my most important issue,",IR
22,71,Wine,was it your most important issue also or not?,QR
22,72,Grocery,"No,so I can do at best 20,000.",IP
22,73,Grocery,Is it okay?,QP
22,74,Wine,Um.,MI-N
22,75,Grocery,Cuz I cant go further.,IB
22,76,Wine,"Right because for me I might be willing to go 7:30 to 7:30 pm if we could up that to 25,000.",OM
22,77,Grocery,Alright.,RP
22,78,Wine,Youll do that?,QM
22,79,Grocery,Yeah.,MI-N
22,80,Wine,Wow.,MI-C
22,81,Grocery,We are done right?,QM
22,82,Wine,"I think so,let me just look at how I did, because we may need to renegotiate.",MIN

22,84,Wine,"Im okay with what I have,that worked out.",MI-C

22,86,Wine,Do you want see if theres any more optimal solutions since we finished so early?,PO
22,87,Grocery,Um yeah.,MI-N
22,88,Wine,"Because there was something it made me,ya know",MI-N
22,89,Wine,"in order of importance for me,it goesrenovation cost, hours of operation, temperature, floor space, grand opening date.",IR
22,90,Grocery,"And then for me its grand opening date,and then hours of operation, and then temperature, floor space and renovation cost.",IR
22,91,Wine,So renovation cost is totally one that youre easy to give up on.,INN
22,92,Wine,So that was a good tradeoff.,MIC
22,93,Grocery,Yeah.,MI-N
22,94,Wine,"Grand opening date,if I was gonna trade something off that was good for me because temperature was important to me.  ",PO
22,95,Wine,UmYou know I think we probably..,MI-N
22,96,Grocery,Finished.,MI-N
22,97,Wine,I think we probably maximized it for both of us.,MI-C
22,98,Grocery,Really.,MI-N
22,99,Wine,"Thats what I suspect,because in the long run. if this relationship is gonna work we both have to feel like  we got enough out of it.",MU
22,100,Grocery,"Thats good,very good.",MI-C
22,101,Grocery,Its even better then what I expect.,MI-C
22,102,Grocery,Because we both are happy.,MI-C

22,106,Wine,"As far asyeah,Um..",OT
22,107,Grocery,Theres no argument or something you know?,OT
22,108,Wine,"If you were gonna getif I were to up my points drastically someplace,the thing that would up my points a lot would be to um.would be to spend more on renovation",OT
22,109,Wine,but that would decrease your points Im guessing.,,Wait renovation is your 5th most important?,OT
22,110,Grocery,"Yeah,my last one",OT
22,111,Grocery,but I have still have at least something because to agree on temperature I get zero points on that.,OT
22,112,Wine,Yeah and I got zero points on grand opening date.,OT
22,113,Wine,But heres the question.,OT
22,114,Wine,"I could improve my score a little bit,by spending an extra five thousand on  renovation cost but opening up an hour earlier and closing an hour earlier.",OT
22,115,Grocery,What do you mean?,OT
22,116,Wine,What we agreed to was 8:30am to 8:30pm.,OT
22,117,Grocery,730 to 730 is what you said down there.,OT
22,118,Wine,Oh no I said..i thought we agreed to 8:30 to 8:30.,OT
22,119,Wine,Oh did we agreed to 7:30?,OT
22,120,Grocery,"Yeah because you said this way,in this way you can umm..",OT
22,121,Wine,"Right I get the 25,000,so if I did the 6:30 to 6:30",OT
22,122,Wine,but we spend 30 thousand on renovation coststhat would get me a few more points.,OT
22,123,Grocery,Say it again please.,OT
22,124,Wine,If we opened up at 6:30 to 6:30 but spend more on renovation that would increase my points score.,OT
22,125,Wine,Would that increase your points score?,OT
22,126,Grocery,"Yes,so you say 6:30 and then 30k, also then 60 percent, 65 degrees and then September 1st.",OT
22,127,Grocery,Thats good to me.,OT
22,128,Wine,"That gets me,yep, that improves my point score a little bit.",OT
22,129,Wine,Lets see if theres anything else that might improve our points scores.,OT
22,130,Wine,I dont think so.,OT
22,131,Grocery,Cuz we kind of go for the extreme case.,OT
22,132,Wine,We did go for the extreme case to improve our points score.,OT
22,133,Wine," Because I got my highest on the things that were 3,4,5 to you.",OT

24,4,Wine,Is that how you want to do it or do you want to go item by item?,PO
24,5,Grocery,"Umm. Okay,first..",P1
24,6,Wine,First one?,QM
24,7,Wine,Okay so my proposal is I think will work for both us is I like to have the hours of operation 10:30 in the morning til 10:30 in the night.,IP
24,8,Wine,I think that would be good time to get people that are shopping for lunch and shopping for dinner and so forth.,SBR
24,9,Wine,"And then I think we need to do is renovation of this place,we gotta put up a good front to attract people.",SBR
24,10,Wine,"So I think we should go with 30,000 dollars. 30 renovation,then I was thinking maybe Id take about 30 percent of the spot.",IP
24,11,Wine,I mean the wine doesnt take up that much room and Im sure you have more stuff that you need to spread out since you have much more of a variety of grocery stuff than I do with wine.,SBR
24,12,Wine,And Im thinking maybe to have 65 degrees as the temperature helps keep the wine cool and tasting good.,IP
24,13,Wine,Im sure itll help you too with keeping fruit outside.,SBR
24,14,Wine,Im thinking maybe we open around July 1st would work really well for me.,IP

25,4,Grocery,"Yep,we should.",MI-C
25,5,Wine,I have a few issues here;,PO
25,6,Wine,I think my big issues here are the hours of operation and renovation costs.,IR
25,7,Wine,"In terms of the hours of operation,were going to be in Dupont Circle.",SF
25,8,Wine,I mean were talking metropolitan area this is not going to be people that will be waking up early in the morning. These are people that will be working late.,SB-R
25,9,Wine,Theyre either going to be coming home late or theyre going to be cruising around town here. I dont see too much sense opening up the place up really early here.,SB-R
25,10,Wine,"Im thinking the very earliest at 9,9:30 in the morning.",IP
25,11,Wine,"Being able to stay open late,9:30 at night when people are still around.",SB-R

25,14,Wine,"Well,theres that and I think its important to renovate the place here.",IP
25,15,Wine,"Because if it doesnt look that nice,especially in Dupont Circle, people just wont go in.  Theyre going to be looking for glitz and glamour and all that stuff. Theyre going to want a nice little place here.",SB-R

25,18,Wine,"Me I think its fair that we have money going into this,/ and opening early.",RT
25,19,IP
25,20,Grocery,So the most concern for you is the operation hours and renovation cost.,IR
25,21,Wine,Correct.,MI-N
25,22,Grocery,"Okay,what Im most concerned about is our opening date",IR
25,23,Grocery,because I need some time to buy stuff and time to train our new employees.,SB-E
25,24,Grocery,So uh if I get more time itll be more beneficial for my business.,SB-R
25,25,Grocery,So how boutlet me think about it.,MI-N
25,26,Grocery,"HmmIm not really concerned about the renovation cost,I think we can get some point at this point.",IR
25,27,Grocery,Im a little concerned about the operation hours because Im running a grocery store.,SB-R
25,28,Grocery,So probably people will probably buy breakfast before they go to work.,SB-R

25,31,Grocery,Grab a cup of coffee?,SBR

25,34,Wine,Grocery,"Uh huh,probably.",MI-N
25,35,Wine,Thats why Im a little concerned so probably well have to discuss this first about operation hours.,P1
25,36,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
25,37,Wine,In terms of floor space I was aiming for 40 percent.,IP

25,53,Grocery,I can understand why youd need a little bit lower temperature for your wine.,IN-P
25,54,Grocery,But 69 degree means I have to pay more electricity per month.Because my stuff dont need that temperature.,SB-R
25,55,Grocery,How about you pay a little more on decoration and Ill pay a little more on electricity.,PP
25,56,Grocery,Because you know for me I think the space is good enough for me to open up a grocery store.  I dont think theres a need for me to decorate the place.,SB-R

25,91,Grocery,You got 40 percent and I got 60 percent and,IS
25,92,Grocery,Is it okay for you to open our new shop on September 1st?,OS
25,93,Wine,See thats the thing.  I want to get this done as early as possible here.,IP
25,94,Wine," I mean I understand you got training time,training time issues here.",IN-P
25,95,Wine,"So I mean we dont want to open up May 1st here,but I mean, I would think a month should be plenty of time to train the new people here.",SB-R
25,96,Wine,Im thinking June 1st would be fine to open.,IP
25,97,Grocery,"It seems we have pay so much in 25,000 and I pay 25,000 and for decorations.",SB-R
25,98,Grocery,Do you think we should keep more time for that because we spend that much on decorations. So probably we have more time to make sure everythings all right for opening.,SB-R
25,99,Wine,I mean I could understand that argument a little bit but uh I dont see how decorations would really push the time off per se. I dont see how decorating would cost us time opening up. ,SB-R
25,100,Grocery,Because Ive been thinking about for me I have to start planning everything after the decorations to put the stuff on the shelf and training the new employees to become familiar with everything.,SB-R
25,101,Wine,And theres just no way you can train at the same time your doing decorations.,SB-R
25,102,Wine,That doesnt seem like..,MI-N
25,103,Grocery,You canI dont know for me I definitely dont want to work in a place there is under decorations.,SB-R
25,104,Grocery,"Theres nails,I think thats not good for",SB-R
25,105,Wine,Yeah but I mean thats just the way running a business ya know. You got to deal with what you got there.,SB-R
25,106,Grocery,So for me I need more time for me I think more time for me to prepare better for my business.,SB-E
25,107,Grocery,Obvious that wont work for me.,RN
25,108,Wine,Why dont we get back to the hours of operation.,P1
25,109,Wine,"Do you really think,you think theres going to be a breakfast crowd? You think theres going to be people coming in for that?",SB-R

25,112,Grocery,"I understand,thats true.",MI-C
25,113,Wine,"On the other hand and having a liquor store close at 6:30,7:30 at night. Thats kind of a mood point. I basically cut some of my business down to like Saturdays and Sundays.",SB-R
25,114,Wine,SoI obviously I like it as late as possible here.,IP
25,115,Grocery,I can understand that.,MI-C
25,116,Grocery,But,MI-N
25,117,Wine,"Alright,this is what Im seeing here. If we open up at 830 in the morning that should still get a good chunk of your breakfast crowd.",PC
25,118,Grocery,Probably.,MI-N
25,119,Wine,"That should probably be enough time to get people into my store,I dont think my clientele are exactly going to be the people going out making a late night run looking for liquor anyways. ",MI-C
25,120,Wine,So if we went for 8:30 in the morning to 8:30 in the evening.,OS
25,121,Wine,I think that would be a way to compromise both your crowd for the breakfast people and my wine customers.,PC
25,122,Grocery,That sounds good.,RP
25,123,Wine,Alright.,MI-N
25,124,Grocery,The grand opening dateI really prefer on September 1st to open.,IP
25,125,Grocery,"I think thats,that good for me to have time to prepare for that but hmm.",SB-R
25,126,Wine,"Alright lets say decorations take a month,if you work on training I think that would be a month tops there. If we combined month for decorations and month for trainingthat would push us back to July 1st.",SB-R
25,127,Wine,I already got my wine and liquor ready I dont really need too much training.,SB-R
25,128,Wine,Im willing to sit back for a little bit but I think July 1st would be the way to go for me.,OS
25,129,Wine,"Im already holding back two months,I dont see how that could really hurt you guys too much at this point, if we went for July 1st.",SB-R
25,130,Grocery,Uh huhJuly 1st.,MI-N
25,131,Grocery,Let me think if I could make it on time. 60 days prepare for the business.,MI-N

28,16,Grocery,What do you think?,QP
28,17,Wine,"Well,I think that would provideI think that would present something of a problem for the wine business",RN
28,18,Wine," becauseyou know,people like to drink wine in the evening.",SBR
28,19,Wine,"Dupoint circle is the kind of neighborhood where you dont have a lot of families,you know, you have young single people that like to be out late.",SBR

28,21,Wine,,"You know,after theve gotten off work, maybe even after theve had dinner, or right before there going to eat, you know,  cook dinner.",SBR
28,22,Wine,"So,I really feel thats an important issue for the wine shop is to be open a lot later, I think, then 6:30 pm.",IP
28,23,Wine,I think that would be a real hardship for my goal. ,SBR
28,24,Grocery,Yeah I know that.,MIC
28,25,Grocery,"What considered families and the young people,qualities that, which they have to have.",SBR
28,26,Grocery,"The family,they come to buy grociers, and wine probably just after work.  For, for, some people come in the morning to have breakfast.",SBR

28,29,Wine,"You know,people, they go to dupoint circle to stay out late, they like to walk around at night, its a nice neighborhood for walking around.",SBR
28,30,Wine,"Maybe theyll see the wine shop still open,go in, buy a bottle.",SBR
28,31,Wine," Before they,you know, have a drink, before they, go to sleep and that sort of thing.",SBR
28,32,Wine,I really think we should keep it opena little bit later.,IP
28,33,Wine,"The people there you know,Washington D.C., is a city where people work really really late.",SBR
28,34,Wine,"You know,everyones a work-a-holic, so keep the store open, you know, they may not have eaten yet so theyll stop in buy some food too at 8 or 9 oclock and then buy there bottle of wine.",SBR
28,35,Wine,"I think it could be,long term maybe, mutually beneficial for both of us",MU
28,36,Grocery,OkaySo what time your thinking best for you?,QP
28,37,Wine,Wellobviously keeping it later would be best for me.,IP
28,38,Wine,Id be willing to goclosing time as early as 9:30.,OS
28,39,Wine,But anythingearlier then that  I think is too much for me.,IB
28,40,Grocery,Wellsince we need to have finished on the same route and I guess we need to reach an agreement..,MIC
28,41,Grocery,"9:30,well its reasonably bad for me/ because from 9:30 am then I lose the morning business. Right?",RN/ SBR
28,42,Grocery,"And I guess,probably we can find a timethat benefits both of us .",PC
28,43,Grocery,Probably like 7:30 am to 7: 30 pm.,OS
28,44,Wine,"Yeah,I think that wouldI would lose too much business...",RN

28,46,Wine,Yeah.,MIN
28,47,Wine,"That one I just cant,I cant close that early.",RN
28,48,Grocery,Okayuh,MIN
28,49,Wine,"Maybe if we compromise8:30 pm depending on how much we can spend on the renovations,",PC
28,50,Wine,"because thats my other,I think my, those are my top two issues",IR
28,51,Wine,Especially if were going to be working in Dupoint Circle.,SBR
28,52,Grocery,"Well,if we choose 8:30 to 8:30 then have about we have the grand opening on August 1rst.",OM

28,57,Wine," I dont like to wait around,you know everythings ready to go for me.",SBR
28,58,Grocery,"Well,to me its not ready",SBR
28,59,Grocery,because I need time to train my employees,SBR
28,60,Grocery,and to provide better service for customers.,SBR
28,61,Grocery," SoI absolutely we need more time and Septermber 1st is the best time for me,",IP
28,62,Grocery,but consider you then probably we can make up a time.,PC
28,63,Grocery,"Since,the hours of operation till 8:30 am - 8:30 pm is, is, not good for me, but consider if you, if  the grand opening on august 1st, then I can take the 8:30-8:30.",OM
28,64,Wine,"Yeah. I feel 8:30-8:30 for me,is already a pretty big compromise.",RN
28,65,Wine,So I feel that Id really hurt myself if I agreed to an 8:30 closing time,SBR
28,66,Wine," and then also waiting,you know, four whole months before selling wine at the location.",SBR
28,67,Wine,So I dont really feel like I can compromise,MINEG
28,68,Grocery,So 8:30 am  8:30 pm and opening on August 1rst is difficult for you?,QS
28,69,Wine,"Yeah. I mean,both of those conditions would be acceptable if we could spend a lot, I mean, top dollar on renovating the store.",PP
28,70,Wine,Sowere going to be opening on Dupoint circle.,SF
28,71,Wine,"Dupoint circle is one of these places,you know, where people pay 2500 hundred dollars a month for there nice apartments, they have good jobs.",SBR

28,73,Wine,,"there going to a place where they can spend their hard earned money,and you know, see other people.",SBR
28,74,Wine,"So I would,I would, actually compromise on August 1rst opening and 8:30 closing time if we could really spendthe maximum amount of money on renovation.",PP
28,75,Wine,"Because thats my,thats my other big issue,",IR
28,76,Wine,I really need a store that looks nice.,SBR
28,77,Wine,"You know,if I am going to move into this community, I have a reputation to protect, I need to have a nice store.",SBR
28,78,Wine,,Im sure you feel the same way.,SBR
28,79,Wine,Well,MIN
28,80,Grocery,"Well,for 30 K, for 30 K thats too much for renovation.",IP
28,81,Grocery," I mean,Ill lose all the money for training if I put all the money in renovation.",SBR
28,82,Grocery,"So,while theres, theres only budget for the training and the renovation is 30,000 thousand.",SBR
28,83,Grocery,"I mean I can agree on20,000 thousand the bottom line here.",IB
28,84,Wine,Yeah.,MIN
28,85,Wine," I mean,if we did do the 30,000 thousand but if we compromised on the hours of operation and the opening date.",PP
28,86,Wine," I think you would be saving some value there,that you could use to train your employees.",SBR
28,87,Wine," And you will have more time to train,and so forth, if we wait, you know, a little bit longer down the road.",SBR
28,88,Grocery,"30,000 thousand,you know, is like initial startup money for training and renovations because we havet made any benefit from selling stuff.",SBR
28,89,Grocery,"Okay,soif so its ok with you if we take 8:30 am to 8: 30 pm plus the training, ok, renovations plus August 1rst?",OS
28,90,Wine,"Those conditionsyou know I feel like Ive compromised a lot,I can accept those conditions.",PC
28,91,Wine,But we still havent gotten to another issue thats really going to affect my stock.,SBR
28,92,Wine,"And Im not sure about the food business,Ive only been in the, in the wine business.",SF
28,93,Wine," I dont know if youre a wine drinker yourself,but, you know were going to be opening in Dupoint Circle, like I said, and people, you know, they want a nice store.",SBR
28,94,Wine,"There going to be buying expensive wines and they want that wine to be,you know, in perfect condition when they buy it.",SBR
28,95,Grocery,I see,MIN
28,96,Wine,So I also really need the store to be at a cooler temperature then you might otherwise have.,IP
28,97,Wine,"Especially at this time in the year,when you know the washington D.C. summers are so hot.",SBR
28,98,Wine," People are coming in and out,the store can warm up very quickly.",SBR
28,99,Wine," You know,thats deadly to the wine.",SBR
28,100,Wine,It really needs to be cool,IP
28,101,Grocery,"Yeah I know but if we keep the temperature really low,we pay too much utlities",SBR
28,102,Grocery,"and also that will hurt you,right?",SBR
28,103,Wine,"Its true but,I also, you know,  Im in the wine business to make money.",SBR
28,104,Wine,"In my experience,people, you really make your money on the wines that are, you know,  are expensive.",SBR
28,105,Wine," Because you can usually get those wines at a good deal and pass those prices on to the consumers,french wine thats worth a lot to them.",SBR
28,106,Wine,"When they drink that,it has to be good, or there not going to come back and buy another, you know $50 bottle of French wine.",SBR
28,107,Wine," So,I really feel like its worth it long term to keep the store at a cool temperature.",IP
28,108,Wine," You know,I feel like it would benefit, you know, you as well, selling fresh produce and specialty foods",SBR
28,109,Grocery,"Well,if we have, if we spend a lot of money on utlitiles then we push the money. We need to raise the price in order to pay the utilities.",SBR
28,110,Grocery,"And then,thats not good to us, as opposed to you and me because if we raise the price then people will just go to another place.",SBR
28,111,Grocery," How do you think about 69,69 degree?",OS
28,112,Wine,"69 is really,I think its pushing it for the wine.",RN
28,113,Wine,Id really like to go 67 degrees on this one.,IP
28,114,Wine,"You know,cause weve already cut a little corners on the renovation from my perspective, you know.",SBR
28,115,Wine,We need to make this store look like its fancy because people are coming in to buy.,SBR
28,116,Wine,"You know,wine is not an everyday product, its a , you know, a vanity product. People buy it for special occasions. It just really needs to be good.",SBR
28,117,Wine,,
28,118,Wine,SBR
28,119,Wine,"So if were going to cut a little bit of corners,a few corners on renovations, then I would really like it to be a little cooler in the store.",IP
28,120,Grocery,"Well consider if youre willing to have the opening late and consider people  are going to be willing to buy wines,8:00 pm or 7:00 pm its already cool outside.",SBR
28,121,Grocery,"So they probably dont think the ice beer,ice wine, they probably think it doesnt makes too much difference.",SBR
28,122,Wine,It really does.,SBR
28,123,Wine," Wine at this level,at this level is really expensive, Im sure, it really hurts my bottom line.",SBR
28,124,Wine,"You know,the thing with the wine business also is that you build a relationship with your customers because most people arent experts on wine.

28,132,Grocery:,Floor space.,P1
28,133,Grocery:," Floor space,I guess half having, probably having the best you not having too much wine.",IP
28,134,Grocery:,While you dont have too much wine then maybe you can consider letting me take and we can spend a little more money on renovations.,SBR
28,135,Wine,"So,how much more money would you be willing to spend on the renovations?",QP
28,136,Grocery,"Well,if you give 70% of the floor space, then I can spend 25 K for renovations",OM
28,137,Wine,"I think that would be fine because,like I said,  the renovations for me really, you know, I mean, I really want the store to look nice.",RP
28,138,Wine,"If we could spend more,Id be happy to take more of the floor space, display mine wares and pay more of the rent.",PP

I mean, I believe we will share a lot of customers in the future./ So I do believe that a good looking environment is critical to my store,/",SBR

33,48,Wine,I would like to spend most of this money on the exterior looking./,SB-R
33,49,Wine,I would like to have a good looking to attract the people walking around so theyll choose our store instead of other places at their first glance of our store./,SB-R
33,50,Wine,"So thats my thinking but we can discuss about this since this is our shared space,so I wanna/",MU
33,51,Grocery,"Well again,somewhere between the average would be 20,000 then, just half as much./",PC
33,52,Grocery,"Its twice as much as what I want to spend so actually,twice asif you..if you want to spend more than half, thats 15,000, so I wouldI mean, theres no structural problem./",SB-R
33,53,Grocery,"We dont have to.everythings just decorative and obviously,for the grand opening we need to have everything done in advance./",SB-R
33,54,Wine,"And for this,I am thinking about the long-term benefits of decorating the store./",SB-R
33,55,Wine,"If we buy better quality decorations,we can stand for longer times, thats better for us to save money in the future with thinking about using more money now to save for the future./",SB-R
33,56,Grocery,"Also,if you want to spend $30,000, things might take a bit more time, so are you planningnot that we have to negotiate the grand opening right now but in you know, in accordance with renovation costs, it seems like you are going to need more time if you really want to spend that much money./",SB-R
33,57,Wine,"Thats true,thats true, and I agree./",MI-C

33,61,Grocery,and I think I have more.Im going to have more startup costs than you as far as products and things because I think youll be able to bring a lot of that from before and/,SB-R
33,62,Grocery,"so now,I mean, what are you thinking about decoration? So mostly on like the front of the building./",QS
33,63,Wine,"Yeah,cause theres so many liquor and grocery stores nearby we have to have something outstanding and by their first glance they dont know the quality of the goods inside. Theyre pretty much attracted by the outside looking, thinking about that./",SB-R
33,64,Grocery,"Yeah,Im just, see its, its twice as much as what I want to spend and thats only $10,000 less than what you want to spend./",SB-R
33,65,Grocery,"I mean,is there anyway you can do 15,000and maybe we could open a little earlier or something?/",PP
33,66,Wine,"Well for now,yeah, I guess I could go a little earlier on the renovation costs./",RP
33,67,Wine,"So I can compensate this by bringing more from my old store cause I think for the next two items,I need more of your support./",PX

33,75,Wine,Yeah. /,MI-N
33,76,Grocery,"Well yeah,I was trying to think of like, you know, we never shared the space so I was trying to think like, if you haveyoure going to have less room because of course, you can stock wine and things like that, and of course we talked about  our referidgeration units./",SB-R
33,77,Grocery,40%...I dont know what that means for rent.,SB-R

33,86,Wine,"Well,you know, this is the key thing for us, for the liquor and wine cause thats the thing thats most important for us to keep the quality of the wine, liquor/",SB-R
33,87,Wine,so I will like to have the 65 degree as our room temperature./,IP
33,88,Grocery,"Is that for like,outside room temperature?/",QS
33,89,Grocery,Are you going to have referidgeration units or?/,QS
33,90,Wine,Well we have referidgeration units but not all our liquor and wine will in the referidgerator. We still have a lot of stuff outside the referdigerator unit so the temperature is the key for us./,SB-R
33,91,Grocery,Whats the highest temperature you can go without spoiling your products?/,QB
33,92,Wine,"Well I guess 65 degrees is the line,I cannot go beyond that./",IB
33,93,Grocery,You cant? /,QS
33,94,Wine,"No,this is the one I really need your support because thats the key for us./",IR
33,95,Grocery,"I mean,my main concern is that keeping, especially with D.C. summers, keeping it in a big place like this, condition at 65 degrees is going to be really really really expensive./",SB-R
33,96,Wine,"Yeah,I know that, I understand that/",MI-C
33,97,Wine,"but I think for you for the goods in the grocery store,you also need lower temperature to keep them fresh./",SB-R
33,98,Grocery,"Well,my goods, I, most of my goods can stay, theyre fine up to like 75 degrees,/",SB-R
33,99,Grocery,"I always tryI always try to keep things as high as I can you know to save us much money on heating and air conditioning things,",SB-R
33,100,so 65 just seems like/,MiNEG
33,101,Wine,"Its really expenditure on the.yeah,I know that but think about/",SB-R
33,102,Grocery,"Like Ill have referidgeration units for my stuff that needs to stay colder,so thats something you could do as well, is have compartments where, you know, you can have things that need to stay colder, colder./",SB-R
33,103,Wine,But we still have lots of things that cannot go into the referidgerator units. We have to keep the room temperature./,SB-R
33,104,Wine,I consulted with the expertise in wine liquor and they said this is critical./,SB-R
33,105,Grocery,"I know but you can have a unit that stays at 65 degrees just like a unit that keeps my stuff that needs to be below room temperature,below room temperature./",SB-R
33,106,Wine,But that would cost me another big amount of money and I am thinking that,SB-R
33,107,Grocery,"We could share the space. If we both have to do it,we could share the space that keeps things at a particular temperature./",CS
33,108,Grocery,"Because my vegetables,Ill need to keep them around 65 degrees./",MI-C
33,109,Grocery,"But those other things that absolutely dont need to be in the cold,and its just the waymy way to keep everything that cold if we can have one unit and if were really you know,/",CS
33,110,Grocery,if we want to split the bill in half then may be we can have that shared space that run down the middle and have one side each./,CS
33,111,Wine,"Okay,that sounds like a good idea but its still not as good to me as the 65 degrees./",IP
33,112,Wine,How about this?/,MIN
33,113,Wine,"Since we have one item left,the grand opening date, I guess we have disagreement on that, so maybe we can you know, arrange these two items./",PP

33,115,Wine,"Yeah,can I go for the 65 degrees as temperature and you do whatever grand opening date you want?/",PP

33,120,You savedhow much?/,,Grocery,"I only save 5000 because were going to compromise the 20,000,and Ive only saved you knowjust 5000./",SB-R

33,122,Grocery,Well Im going from 75 degrees to 67 degrees./,SB-R
33,123,Wine,Well we dont need the exact amount of money we need for the air conditioning./,SB-R
33,124,Grocery,"No,we dont but the renovation cost is something thatits just, its not as important./",IR

34,7,Wine,So apparently Im dealing with the wine shop here and you got the grocery store.,GD

34,25,Grocery,I wont have enough time to start by that date.,SB-R

34,33,Wine,What about in terms of floor space?,QP
34,34,Wine,"Like youre right that having a smaller floor space is good for me. I assume that having a grocery store,you need to have a little more space.",ID-P
34,35,Grocery,Thats right.,MIN
34,36,Wine,"Okay,well, what would you think of, like 60/40 arrangement where you get 60% and I get 40%?",OS
34,37,Wine,"Cause I do,like I will need, maybe I know its smaller than a grocery store but I will need some room to be able to have all supplies that I do have.",SB-R

34,41,Grocery,"Of course of course,you know, I think I can compensate the smaller space with the opening date a little bit.",PP
34,42,Grocery," So if you can,we can start, opening say September, then I can split the floor 60/40, do you think thats a good outcome?",OM
34,43,Wine,"I think that,thatd probably be okay, yeah.",RP
34,44,Wine,So I guess that means we have two of them done.,PO

34,46,Grocery,Yeah.,RP

34,57,Grocery,"Yeah,I think, well, I would say that hours of operation and temperature are as critical to me as, same critical to me.",IR
34,58,Grocery,So we can probably do some balance between hours and temperature.,PP
34,59,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
34,60,Wine,How do you feel about renovation costs?,QP
34,61,Grocery,"Well we can,I mean I will do justI can do trade for renovation because its less important to me.",IR
34,62,Wine,Okay.,MI-N

34,64,Wine,So how are we going to do that.,PO

34,78,Grocery,"Yeah but,I mean, we can do a sort of a grand place between the three.",PP
34,79,Wine,"Right,okay so",MI-C
34,80,Grocery,"So you can,I mean, okay, how about this choice?",QM
34,81,Wine,Alright.,MI-N
34,82,Grocery,"How about this..okay,7:30 to 7:30, renovation 20,000, temperature 71",OM

34,84,Grocery,Wow.,RN
34,85,Grocery,"Yeah,I guess we are both choosing from the top, the second item from the top in both columns?",OT

34,87,Wine,"and if I understand the way in which this is set up,you want the exact opposite.",ID-P

34,90,Wine,Right.,MI-N
34,91,Grocery,"So,I mean",MI-N
34,92,Wine,Lets put it this way.,MI-N
34,93,Wine,Its better for me to have a higher renovation cost than it is for hours of operation or temperature.,IR
34,94,Wine,Like I would rather spend the maximum on renovation cost and give a bit on both of those.,IR
34,95,Grocery,"Okay,yeah.",MI-N
34,96,Grocery,How about this?,QM
34,97,Grocery,Let me give up the lower issue.,PC
34,98,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
34,99,Grocery,"Then give me a full temperature which is 73,then hours, then hours, say still, 7:30-7:30, you agree?",OM
34,100,Wine,"Lets seewhat about like the same thing but 8:30 to 8:30 on hours of operation,if you could push",OM
34,101,Grocery,"Yeah because renovation thing,a little.Id totally give it up,basically with 0 points.",OT

34,103,Wine,"Okay,okay.",MI-N
34,104,Wine,"Lets see then,so youre saying 73.",MI-N
34,105,Wine,Cause I mean like going all the way on temeperature does make me loseits not a significant concern.,SB-R
34,106,Grocery,"Thats true,okay how we do this.",PO
34,107,Grocery,"Give up,give up renovation costs, I lower my temperature 2 degrees which means 71, then start from 7:30 to 7:30.",OM
34,108,Grocery,Is that a good choice?,MIN
34,109,Wine,Lets see how does that work out?,MI-N

34,111,Wine,"Hmm. /I mean,hmm.",MI-N/MI-N
34,112,Wine,"What if we,what if I gave you back the full temperature and we agree to open at 8:30?",OM
34,113,Grocery,How about you can turn down the temperature?,OM
34,114,Wine,Hours of operation makes more difference to me than temperature.,IR
34,115,Grocery,"Well,if that works..okay, lets, lets do this. I will make it personal.",MI-C
34,116,Grocery,"I agree,full temperature 73 degrees, I give up my renovation costs 30,000, then, we start from 8:30 to 8:30. Deal?",OM
34,117,Grocery,Wine,Deal.,RP
34,118,Grocery,"Okay so that gives us,like, in the middle on hours of operation 8:30 to 8:30, I basically grab the renovation costs, we do the 60/40 floor space, I give you the temperature, and I give you the grand opening date. /Hmm.",MI-N/MI-N

35,31,Grocery,"You only go out and buy some beer or wine,and go back, and have dinner with them right?",SBR
35,32,Grocery,"Or have party,the party begins no later than 7 or 8 or something. Its not that late to till 10 oclock, because that place where people get together, its a place to selling liquor, wine or something. Its just to shop, its not a park.",SBR
35,33,Wine,"Thats true but the problem is that a lot of people,just before they go to a party, they go in and they buy wine and they gothe party might have started.",SBR
35,34,Grocery,Really?,SBR
35,35,Wine,"That does happen sometimes,yeah. Im just pretty sure that liquor stores in general tend to operate pretty late and I think its to catch the crowds that go get liquor late for parties and that sort of thingso its hard.",SBR
35,36,Wine,Well Ill be willing to compromise to 8:30 to 8:30.,OS
35,37,Grocery,"Okay,I think so becauseokay.",RP
35,38,Grocery,The second issue,P1
35,39,Wine,"Okay,the renovation cost.",P1
35,40,Wine,I care a lot about this particular issue.,IR
35,41,Wine,I want to spend as much as possible in renovation,IP
35,42,Wine,"because in the Dupont Circle area,we care a lot about image.",SBR
35,43,Grocery,So how much would you like to offer or something?,QP
35,44,Wine,"Well,I just want it to be as high as possible.",IP
35,45,Grocery,As high as possible?,QM
35,46,Wine,"As high as possible,so 30,000 would be ideal.",IP
35,47,Grocery,Oh!,RN
35,48,Grocery,"But I mean as a shop,were selling things, were just selling liquor, food, and were selling our customer service,",SBR
35,49,Grocery,"and I think,it might be fun to have some decoration around, but I dont think its that important",SBR
35,50,Grocery,because since I know some place where they have very good decoration but people do not go there very often because they have very bad good customer service.,SBR
35,51,Grocery,"So I think,my point is if we can provide good food, liquor, and we can provide good customer service, people will come here",SBR
35,52,Grocery,"because you know,theres some very small places, theyre not so beautiful, theyre not so seem nice, but people go there because they provide good things so.",SBR
35,53,Wine,"So,it just might be a needless expense.",MIC
35,54,Grocery,"Yes,including a 6 star hotel.not many people can afford right?",SBR
35,55,Grocery," So if you spend too much money on that,maybe you might have to spend your liquor much more expensive or something.",SBR
35,56,Grocery,Im not so sure but it will add money to the,SBR
35,57,Wine,It depends on how many people itll attract and I am predicting it will attract many.,SBR
35,58,Wine,"So do you want to spend 10,000 on that or?",QP
35,59,Grocery,"10,000",IP
35,60,Wine,Well which amount would you prefer?,QP
35,61,Wine,"I mean,if you could. If you could have anything you want.",MIN
35,62,Grocery,"15,000,I cant afford because",IP
35,63,Wine,"Okay,well Id go down to 25,000?",OS
35,64,Grocery,"Why not choosing the mean value of that causesince Im selling some food and although under the same roof but do you still think its impossible to that much,to enhance the environment to sell food better?",PC/SBR
35,65,Grocery,"Cause if I were the customer,Id go to place, and I have very good food, Ill remember good service, I will remember the place and tell about the place to my friends.",SBR
35,66,Grocery,"So I think the most important two things to me is service and their,the things they are selling, its not the decoration.",SBR
35,67,Wine,"Still,Im of the opinion that the clientele, particularly in the Dupont Circle area are really sort of the richer trendier types, and it means a lot to them that the store looks nice on the outside and at the very least, itll start attracting customers into the store at the very beginning when it opens, so",SBR
35,68,Grocery,I think its already interesting to have two shops under the same roof right?,SBR
35,69,Wine,Darn it.,MINEG
35,70,Wine,"Um,okay.",MIN
35,71,Wine,Well this is a very important issue for both of us so I dont know.,IDN
35,72,Wine,"I would have to suggest again to compromise and do the middle road which would be 20,000.",OS
35,73,Grocery,Okay.,RP
35,74,Wine,Okay.,MIN
35,75,Grocery,Okay.,MIN
35,76,Wine,Were not a very happy couple of stores.,MINEG
35,77,Wine,Okay.,MIN
35,78,Grocery,Floor space?,P1
35,79,Grocery,"I think cause Im sellinga variety of different things so I need a little bit more space than you to display this kind of products,/ so maybe more than one half,a little bit more like 60 or 70 is okay for me.",SBR/ IP
35,80,Grocery,"I just need to display because they have different shape,different color or something.",SBR
35,81,Grocery,"I cant be compressing into one book,its impossible right?",SBR
35,82,Grocery,So I just need some place to display them.,IP
35,83,Wine,I agree that groceries take up more space and I dont need so much space.,MIC
35,84,Wine,I think my ideal amount would be 40%.,IP
35,85,Grocery,"40%,so mine is 60% right?",QM
35,86,Wine,"Yours,you said 60?",QM
35,87,Grocery,I need 60 or 70.,IP
35,88,Grocery,Wine,60 or 70.,MIN
35,89,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN
35,90,Wine,"Okay,umlets see.",MIN
35,91,Wine,60 or 70.,MIN
35,92,Wine,Would you prefer 70 to 60 or..,QP
35,93,Wine,because I prefer 40%.,IP
35,94,Grocery,"You prefer,you need 40%, so I need 60% then good.",IS
35,95,Grocery,Agree?,OS
35,96,Wine,Thats a good one! Im shocked!,RP
35,97,Grocery,Its not a fight. We just negotiate here.,MIC
35,98,Grocery,"Okay,here comes another important issue, temperature for us.",IR
35,99,Grocery,"Cause were selling different thing,they need to be stored under different temperatures.",ID-N
35,100,Grocery,"To me,the best thing, the best temperatures 73 degrees",IP
35,101,Grocery,because it can keep the food fresh meanwhile we can just save money on electricity bill.,SBR
35,102,Grocery,What do you like?,QP
35,103,Wine,"Well unfortunately,my wines best stored at lower temperatures, so I prefer 65 degrees.",IP
35,104,Grocery,"Oh,65?!",RN
35,105,Wine,Thats quite a range. ,IDN
35,106,Grocery,"Whats a normal temperature,65?",QS
35,107,Grocery,"I thought people you know,store liquor in refridge..in referidgerator or something?",SBR
35,108,Wine,"Yeah,some of them are stored in the fridge.",SBR
35,109,Grocery,"Yeah,so maybe you can store..maybe, I think most stores, shops sell liquor in the referidgerator or something and use a special instrument to store them, not the room temperature.",SBR
35,110,Grocery,"To me,I just place those food in the normal space, not in some special instrument.",SBR
35,111,Grocery,"So the room temperature is important but I dont know,maybe to you, you just need something else to protect, for example, to give them a better taste or something?",SBR
35,112,Wine,"Yeah,I think that they they need to have, to be generally be stored at lower temperatures so that theto perserve the taste or something like that.",SBR
35,113,Wine,So I wouldnt want to be putting all of them in the fridge if I can help it,SBR
35,114,Wine,because that would be a big expense.,SBR
35,115,Wine,All I really need to do is to be about 65 degrees and that would be the ideal.,IP
35,116,Grocery,"Thats too much,thats a big difference.",RN
35,117,Wine,Its a big culprit.,IDN
35,118,Grocery,"So we have to compromise to some extent,right?.",PC
35,119,Grocery,"If you just put all the same,put everything under that temperature, electricity bill will be unaffordable and we share that...we share that many expense.",SBR
35,120,Wine,"It wouldnt be such a bad thing in the winter,just in the summer.",SBR
35,121,Grocery,Right.,MIN
35,122,Grocery,During the winter we can put everything outside. We should keep the room out.,SBR
35,123,Wine,Hmm.,MIN
35,124,Wine,"So,we are once again, polarized here.",IDN
35,125,Wine,"To save time,I will go for the middle ground again.",PC
35,126,Grocery,"Okay,69?",OS
35,127,Wine,Uh-huh.,MIN
35,128,Grocery,Okay.,RP
35,129,Wine,I think my wines wont spoil there.,SBR
35,130,Grocery,"So the final big issue,the grand opening date.",P1
35,131,Grocery,"Ahh,we have to talka little bit more on this issue",PO
35,132,Grocery,"cause as I always insist,the most important thing for the shop is their product and their customer service, so I insist that we should hire some new person, new people and train them and only through this kind of method can be provide good customer service cause we whould be special.",SBR
35,133,Grocery,"We should be very special to give the best service to the customers so... and also,",SBR
35,134,Grocery,I want the grand opening date to be a very special date,SBR
35,135,Grocery,"because I ordered something from abroad,so we still need some time.",SBR
35,136,Grocery,"I think September 1st is ideal day but,",IP
35,137,Grocery,so whats your opinion?,QP
35,138,Wine,"Well,Im all pretty much ready to go.",SBR
35,139,Wine,"I have everything in storage,I have my people trained I guess, and Im ready to go as soon as possible.",IP
35,140,Grocery,"All ready to go,you have old people and new people?",QS
35,141,Wine,"Ahh,they must have transferred from another store.",SBR
35,142,Grocery,"Yeah,they still need time.",SBR
35,143,Wine,"Yeah,so I prefer to the earliest date.",IP
35,144,Grocery,"Maybe I can use,maybe I can use airmail or something to get the things faster but I still needbecause I have noI havent hired the people yet so its impossible",SBR
35,145,Grocery,"because if you open your shop,Im still not ready so, can you please?",SBR
35,146,Grocery,So if I can open August 1st cause I really need time to train them.,IP
35,147,Wine,"I thinktime to trian your employees but still in the meanwhile,Im going to be waiting a month for, I have all my things ready and Im ready to start making money so Im not willing to go too far in this.",SBR
35,148,Wine,So maybe June 1st?,OS
35,149,Grocery,"You know,we hire people, we asked them to go through interviews, and its a very long process. We decide which one can go, we have to train them, and they must behaveget used to a team, to work together, and get familiar with all kinds of things because you know, selling things if they know much better about the product or history or anything, they will serve the customer better so",SBR
35,150,Grocery,I dont think itll be enough time cause,SBR
35,151,Wine,"Okay,well, hmm. I already have some people who have been trained.",SBR
35,152,Grocery,They sell different things.,SBR
35,153,Wine,"True,they are wine experts but still, they can move between stores if necessary.",SBR
35,154,Wine,"They certainly have time,extra time to prepare for it because they wont be working in the month, well they would be if I was giving them extra training essentially.",SBR
35,155,Grocery,They still need time.,SBR
35,156,Wine,They need a little time.,SBR
35,157,Wine,They would have the month between May 1st and June 1st and that would be probably enough to get used to the grocery store instead of the wine store.,SBR
35,158,Grocery,So how about July 1st then?,OS
35,159,Wine,Okay.,RP
35,160,Grocery,Okay.,MIN

36,34,Grocery,"I think we have to open at the same time since its the same store,",OT,,"cause were not,its going to be kind of like two stores in one building so there will be no doors separating my store from your store.",OT,OT

36,43,Wine,So renovation costs?,P1,Grocery,"Okay,I personally would like, the building needs a little bit of work.",SBR,
36,44,Wine,"I know,I can see that but I would like to spend more money on training our employees to be good, to be knowledgeable and to be good sellers.",SBR,
36,45,Wine,Thats where I would like to focus my money so I want to spend a little bit on renovation but not a whole lot.,IP,IP
36,46,Wine,What do you think?,QP,(even if two SBRs)
36,47,Wine,Of course I want to spend as much as I can,IP,," because you know,if the environment is very good, the people in the wine shop will enjoy themselves and",SBR,IP
36,48,Wine,"it is very important to attract,people come here, and feel comfortable, yeah.",SBR,(even if two SBRs)
36,49,Grocery,I can see that.,MIC,,"I also think its important to have well,what we want..do you want to have a good environment,",SBR,

36,61,Wine,In the middle?,QM,Grocery,"How about ifokay,I want to spend 10 and you want to spend 25,",IDN,
36,62,Wine," what ifwe go more towards,more towardsso maybe well dowe can spend more but then I can negotiate more when it comes to the temperature of the building because thats another one of my important issues.",PP,
36,63,Wine,"Um,maybe we can say we can spend 20 for renovation but then I would like the temperature a little bit more warmer",PP,
36,64,Wine,and Im guessing you want it more cool.,INP,PP
36,65,Wine,"Yeah,but why you want it more warmer?",QS,
36,66,Grocery,Because my food will stay good longer if its warmer.,SBR,Wine,Okay.,MIN,Grocery,"So it helps me out because then I wont have tomy food wont spoil as fast,you know what I mean?",SBR,
36,67,Wine,"Yeah,I know what you meanumbut you know, we need to be open for a long time.",MIN,
36,68,Grocery,Whats that?,QM,Wine,I mean your operation hoursyou need to open for very long,MIN,Grocery,"Oh,the hours of operation.",P1,PO
36,69,Grocery,I thought we were going to wait on that one.,PO,Wine,"Yeah,yeah, yeah.",MIN,
36,70,Grocery,Okay.,MIN,Wine,"I know that because you know,the temperaturefrom morning to the afternoon you know?",SBR,
36,71,Grocery,"If you open very early,actuallylet me think, temperatureearly it will be very cold. It will be colder than the afternoon.",SBR,SBR
36,72,Grocery,Grocery,"Right,since I want to open early",SBR,
36,73,Grocery,the warmer for me the better,IP,IP
36,74,Grocery,"because you know,its early, its colder in the morning.",SBR,(even if 2 SBRs)

36,78,Grocery,Thats how I feel but I dont know if you have a reason for why youd like to keep it cooler?,QS,(even if two QS)
36,79,Wine,"Yeahyeah,maybe I can give some degrees to you.",PC,
36,80,Grocery,Okay.,MIN,Wine,"Okay,okay, I will mmm.so I will give up 2 degrees if you can give me renovation costs to 25,000.",OM,
36,81,Grocery,I thought we had agreed on 20 for renovation costs?,QM,PP

36,85,Grocery,"Thats true,it is important.",MIC,
36,86,Wine,"Yeah,its really important.",SBR,
36,87,Grocery,"Im not sure that I can afford,I think, okay, Im not sure that I can afford the 25,000 unless we can keep the store a little bit warmer.",PP,
36,88,Grocery,"I can do the 20,000",OS,,"but I dont think I can do 25,000",IB,PP
36,89,Grocery,because air conditioning is expensive.,SBR,,So thats why Im not sure if I can afford to spend the 5000 extra on renovation unless we keep this store a little warmer.,PP,Wine,"So what,whats the definitely important issue to you, except the temperature?",IR,
36,90,Grocery,My other important issue is the opening date.,IR,Wine,"Opening date,okay.",MIN,
36,91,Grocery,"I have apersonally,and Im sure this is true to you too, I have a lot of stuff that needs to be imported in from other countries,",SBR,
36,92,Grocery,as Im sure you get your wines from a lot of other countries right?,QS,SBR
36,93,Wine,"Yeah,yeah, yeah.",MIN,
36,94,Grocery,"And for me and probably for you to have enough in stock,I mean, I need to wait as long as possible so I can have a good stock, so I can have a lot of wine in our, excuse me, food, and for you, wine in stock.",SBR,
36,95,Grocery,So I was hoping to wait preferably until September.,IP,IP
36,96,Wine,"My GOD,so late!",RN,
36,97,Grocery,Well we also need to think about training the employees too,SBR,,"because you know,as we were talking about before, it helps to have knowledeable employees that really knows the store well.",SBR,
36,98,Grocery,I dont want to just in throw in employees that arent sure of what theyre doing because thats not very good for business.,SBR,SBR
36,99,Wine,"But you know,when you do the training, the best training is on the real job.",SBR,
36,100,Grocery,"Thats true,thats true, but I think to a degree, they need to get some background.",SBR,
36,101,Wine,"Yeah,so even if they have background, very few background, you still have to teach the new environment in yourin your what, in your shop.",SBR,
36,102,Wine,"Yeah,so maybe you can think about opening at August 1st and you can think about the first month as a training month.",OS,OS
36,103,Grocery,"Okay,I can do August 1st. Yeah, training month, thats a good way to think about it.",MIC,
36,104,Grocery," Okay,well open August 1st.",RP,RP
36,105,Wine,"So,but this is, this is a condition to win the $25,000.",OM,
36,106,Grocery,"What,what, August 1st is?",QM,
36,107,Wine,"Yeah,August 1st and temperature and the 69 degrees together, I mean.",OM,
36,108,Grocery,I can do the 25 if we can do 71 degrees.,OM,Wine,"But I have already give up August 1st,you know.",RT,
36,109,Grocery,"I thought you wanted,you said you wanted August 1st.",QM,
36,110,Wine,"Yeah,no no no no no.",MINEG,
36,111,Grocery,"I thought because you mentioned August 1st,that was your ideal start date because thats what you had said.",QM,
36,112,Wine,"No,thats the worst, worst date I can give you.",IP,
36,113,Grocery,"Okay,let me see.",MIN,
36,114,Wine,"Because you see,I have give up temperature and grand opening and I only want to win the renovation and 25,000.",PP,
36,115,Wine,It  also benefits you,SBR,PP
36,116,Grocery,"Thats true,I see that.",MIC,

39,3,Wine,Hi.,MIC
39,4,Grocery,"Well,nice to meet you.",MIC
39,5,Wine,Nice to meet you.,MIC
39,6,Grocery,"So,I guess the first thing is first. We should talk about whats going on.",PO
39,7,Grocery,"Im really excited about moving into this new location. Hopefully,well get a lot more business this way.",MIC
39,8,Wine,"Yeah,same thing. I think its a good idea to share the you know, the grocery store and the wine store in the same room, and share the space and things.",MIC
39,9,Grocery,"And I think in Dupont Circle,this will definitely attract a lot of attention.",MIC
39,10,Wine,"Yeah,exactly.",MIC
39,11,Wine,"By the way,what you said attract people, by walk or by car, what do you think is the most importance?",QS
39,12,Wine,"For my opening,renovation is probably the you know, the very big concern for us, how to attract people.",IR
39,13,Wine,"So do you have any idea,you know, trying to",MIN
39,14,Grocery,"Well I guess for me,I mean, visually, the visual appeal of the store isnt as important to me I guess,",IP
39,15,Grocery,"because I kind of like towellI guess I,I havent really, I havent really put that as high on my list of priorities.",
39,16,Grocery,"Sowhat,what are you thinking about doing for, for the renovation?",QP
39,17,Grocery,"I was,I was thinkining minimal renovations.",IP
39,18,Grocery,"because I already have spent a lot of money on procuring groceries from faraway places,faraway lands and all that.",SBR
39,19,Grocery,"So I guess my,my preference is to do less, less work on the renovations than than is really necessary.",IP
39,20,Grocery,What were you thinking about doing?,QP
39,21,Wine,"I think since you know,were wine, kind of market is present some high-level. I think what we put together should give people the passion you know, you provide very high quality foods and grocery.",SBR
39,22,Wine,,"I think every people want to see that immediately,even when they only buy wine, they immediately thought okay, next store or next space, the grocery is going to be the wonderful.",SBR
39,23,Wine,"I dont need to go somewhere else to get fresh food,groceries, so I think for  the renovation, I have idea, if you look for the long-run, definitely were going to get back the money.",SBR
39,24,Wine,"So I dont want you know,cost money on this, try to you know, give some people bad impression because partially you know, have two things together, like the cost things together.",SBR
39,25,Wine,"So Im thinking Im not lenient on renovation /but I agree with you,you want to spend a lot of money on the food, preparing things,",Mineg/ MIC
39,26,Wine,"but I think we have to find some way so we you know,both going to be satisfied.",MU
39,27,Grocery,"Sure,sure.",MIC
39,28,Grocery,"I mean,I, I could see, I guess, I could see now a way to spending a little more on the renovation but in that case, just because of all the stuff I may be bringing in from out of state and everything, maybe it would be possible for, I dont know if youve thought about how much, how were going to divide the store up",PP
39,29,Grocery,"but I was thinking that it would be better for me if I were able to spread out /because just my,my inventory is so diverse that I really want to be able to kinda present in a, in a more spare fashion.",IP/SBR
39,30,Grocery," I dont like the look of like the convenience store where things are piled right on top of each other,",SBR
39,31,Grocery,"so maybe if I could get a larger portion of the store,like about 60% of the floor plan, then maybe I could, I could definitely see a way to spending more on the renovations to kind ofso that way itll kind of even out for me at least.",PP
39,32,Wine,"Yeah,I think I agree with you.",RP
39,33,Wine,"60%,I think thats, thats kind of reasonable,",IP
39,34,Wine,"because grocery store,you need so many, you know, different goods and you have to divide.",INP
39,35,Wine,"I agree with you on that,no problem.",MIC
39,36,Grocery,"Okay,so how much would you like to spend I guess on the, renovations?",QP
39,37,Wine,"Renovation,I think I can takethats only my present opening, I take the 30K,",IP
39,38,Wine,"cause I think thatsyou know the Dupont Circle,and with the you know, beautiful buildings there, we have to be like unique, and also we have to want people you know, to.., as long as they past D.C. around Dupont Circle, they immediately point, okay, thats where we want to go.",SBR
39,39,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN
39,40,Wine,"So Im not sure you know,if you want to chip in?",QP
39,41,Grocery,"No I mean that,I think I can do that, I think we can do that.",MIC
39,42,Grocery,"I mean if,as long as I have more space to spread out my goods, I think I would be okay withII could definitely see my way to spending the 30,000, soI can do that.",PP
39,43,Wine,"Okay,thats great.",MIC
39,44,Grocery,"I guess we should also,we should probably decide now that none ofnothing is final until we actually say it at the end.",PO
39,45,Wine,"Yeah,exactly.",MIC
39,46,Grocery,"Just in case,soyeah.",MIN
39,47,Wine,"So we can yeah,both discuss our other issues.",PO
39,48,Grocery,"I guess for me,the most, the absolute important number 1 thing for me is that /because again, I have to collect all these things from far away, my other stores, I havent really, we dont have a lot of inventory to spare my other stores.",IR/SBR
39,49,Grocery,So Im not sure when you would like to open but I would definitely like to have alot of time to get all these goods,IP
39,50,Grocery,and I guess also for doing all these renovations will have to allow for some time.,SBR
39,51,Grocery,"But I think for me the earliest Ill be able to do it,or the earliest Id want to do With September",IP
39,52,Grocery,"because Ive got,I just have all this time collecting all this goods and everything so I dont know if Ill be able to really have my part of the store ready if it was any earlier than that.",SBR
39,53,Wine,"Have you thought about,that, thingsFrom September its too long, can we do like, you know, partially?",CS
39,54,Wine,"So you still bring food in but we open earlier like the grand open I know for my experience from the wine,you know, but I also have some experience grocery store.",CS
39,55,Wine," So sometime they do,like you know, you have the 60% of space so you probably focus on like 30% renovation of the outside done. Inside you already have 30% done, you put the food because you take time from out-state to here, and wine is set up and then we can grand open that, then we think the otherways, we can have some like, just, simple decoration and some food not for sale but for display.",CS
39,56,Wine,"Give some people passion,this you know, store already started and attract the people to come. When they come, theyre going to have some more interest and we can talk to them and can probably bring much difference for them, so thats what Im thinking.",SBR
39,57,Wine,"For grand the like,grand open, I agree with you, you need time, thats the renovation and order the stuff",MIC
39,58,Wine,but my thinking is you also have to meet with customers.,SBR
39,59,Wine,"So if we attract some people to come here and after we asked for some feedback andand if they have some expectation we didnt provide,then in like the another 30% of space or like 10% of space, we can put something they want. So maybe thats good.",CS
39,60,Grocery,"Okay,I can see that a little bit I guess but Ijust considering the high end, just the really classy kind of clientele that were expecting to find in Dupont Circle, these are the kind of people that value aesthetic appeal and I..at least from my experience, II dont think that I would expect the customers to react very well to store that doesnt look finished when its opened.",SBR
39,61,Grocery,"So I mean,Im not, I guess in your case, if your if your side of the store is easier to build up then that might be better for you but for me, Id just like to make sure that Ill be able to get these, Ill be able to get kind of everything ready by the time we, we open up.",INN/SBR
39,62,Grocery,"I mean,maybe we can kind of hold off and deciding that and we can talk about that a little later.",PM
39,63,Wine,Yeah.,MIN
39,64,Wine,"Yeah,I think opening time, yes, let me think about that because for you know, probably its too easy for me because wine store and the wine setup is much easier than you, yeah.",PM
39,65,Wine,I need to think about that soyeah.,MIN
39,66,Grocery,We have 15 minutes.,PT
39,67,Wine,Yeah.,MIN
39,68,Wine,"How about the,the most concern of the two things is operating hours and temperature.",IR
39,69,Grocery,Mmhmm.,MIN
39,70,Wine,Thats two I want to brought up because I have some grocery store experience.,SBR
39,71,Wine,"You and the people you know,not go early to the shopping but after work, theyre going to shop late, shopping later. So thats why I want to brought up some like operation hours things.",SBR
39,72,Wine," Im not sure,do you have any idea what you can do for hours?",QP
39,73,Grocery,"Well,in much the same way as all of these issues, I feel the exact opposite way.",IP
39,74,Grocery," Well,my customers areIm hoping were going to have a little deli counter with bagels and cream cheese and coffee and so I guess aboutwere hoping to get about half of our business from the early morning shoppers, the people that are on their way to work, so not necessarily going grocery shopping but going to work and I guess stop and get some breakfast.",SBR
39,75,Grocery,"Were hoping to take way some of the crowd from that Starbucks next door,/ so I guess for me,the earlier the better. I had kind of hoped that we could open at basically a time when noone would be at work yet so as early as 6:30 but I mean,",SBR/ IP
39,76,Grocery,"I wouldnt mind opening a little later either I guess,most people dont start working until 9 /so maybe if we opened at 7:30 that would be okay",PC/OS
39,77,Grocery,"but IIm justIm pretty,Im pretty firm about the idea of having this kind of breakfast counter with the bagels and I dont think that would do very well after 9 oclock am for instance. I dont think wed get anyone to come in and get bagels and coffee whatever at 9 oclock, I think.",SBR
39,78,Wine,"Yeah,I think I saw your point, but do you have calculation, how much portion, on this one?",MIC/QS
39,79,Wine,"I mean like,breakfast, and how many customers you can attract from Starbucks?",QS
39,80,Grocery,"Yeah,well the nice thing about our breakfast meal is that coffee and bagels and cream cheese are really really easy to make and really cheap to buy, so itour profit margin, the kind of profit were looking at from the breakfast crowd would be significantly higher than, than if we didnt have the breakfast crowd at all.",SBR
39,81,Grocery,"So I dont know,we were kind of hoping to make maybe 40% of our revenue off of just these breakfast foods and everything because like I said, were next to Starbucks but were in Dupont Circle where a lot of people has this kinda anti-establishment feeling and probably feel guilty about going to Starbucks and if we can take some of those customers away to come into our store, that would be I think would we would be able to get a good portion of our business from that.",SBR
39,82,Wine,"Yeah. I think that one is just opposite of we,what Id thought, Id mentioned before.",IDN
39,83,Wine,See thats,MIN
39,84,Grocery,"Well,I guess we can also, we can also talk about that closing time because you, I guess, if were looking to stay open, if were only going to be open for 12 hours, its clear that we definitely want to make sure that, cause I mean, I",MIN
39,85,Grocery,,"I cant imagine someone coming in at 6:30 am and buying wine./ So I definitely understand the need to have the store open a little later too. So if wemy issue is just that I want to get the store open and running and have a few people in there before 9 oclock,so I would love to have it open at 7:30 just for that one hour and a half",SBR/IP
39,86,Grocery,"I was hoping we could really get a lot of people in there and also I mean,most people are out of work at 5:30, 6 oclock and so well still be open for that, that kinda wine shop thing and people could come in after work for grocery shopping too and theyll, theyll grab some wine and vice versa.",SBR
39,87,Grocery,Im sure you guys will bring in some clientele for me if were still open at 7:30.,SBR
39,88,Wine,"Yeah,but think about thelike the traffic and instead of the dinner, some of the customers are going to go after work and come back to buy wine, just to buy wine.",SBR
39,89,Wine,"I think 7:30 from 7:30 to 7:30 is still like a little bit earlier than what I thought,",IP
39,90,Wine,"soand also the rational thingIm not surebecause you have experience in the grocery,Im not quitebut from my personal experience, I dont think much crowded you know during that 12 hours, for example, 7, 7:30.",SBR
39,91,Wine,"Even if people are going to come like around,after work, if theyre going to show up after work, around like, this, this portion of people around like 6:30.",SBR
39,92,Wine," So if you only let them 1 hour to show up in probably you know,restrict that the",SBR
39,93,Grocery,"That,I guess thats kinda been true in surburan markets like out, out in the suburbs when people are driving to work but were looking at,  like the kind of people were grabbing or at least Im picturing our clientele, in Dupont Circle, youre not going to be driving to the grocery store anyway, theres not parking lot, so I mean, the only way that they can even get there is, is by walking unless they took the metro of course as well but I mean, parking in Dupont Circle, the only time that you can really find a spot in Dupont Circle is exactly at 6:30 cause thats when the parking restrictions are lifted.",SBR
39,94,Grocery,"So I mean parking,basically,Im picturing our customers just either, either being those rare people who are driving through and see a spot at 6:30 and maybe they want to stop in for a minute. These wont be like, these wont be long time shoppers. These are going to be people that are going to be picking up a bottle of wine on a way to a friends party, and just not, you know, not going to be browsing for a long time.",SBR
39,95,Grocery,"And I mean,same thing, I think that people that are leaving, that are walking by are more likely to stop if they see us open when theyre actually walking home from work rather than going home and then kinda resting up and then coming back out because we have kind of a young, you know, we have a young crowd thats going to be out to bars and having fun with their friends, so, I dont know so Im kinda picturing our clientele to be the kind of person that would finish work and then they would stop if they saw the open and if its convenient but they wouldnt necessarily go home and then come back.",SBR
39,96,Wine,"Yeah,yeah, thats also true.",MIC
39,97,Wine,"Im thinkingyeah,you mentioned one like cause of concern, like instead of go to bar and just you know buy wines, thats also my concern. See if you want to go buy, you can stay until midnight.",SBR
39,98,Wine,,"So for customers to just drop buy and buy a bottle of wine,its very convenient way just to walk and probably they already have fun you know at bar but they will still not be enjoying due to the time, kind of late, so they you know just buy wine and enjoying at home,",SBR
39,99,Wine,"so thats why Im most concerned if little bit late,its going to be very convenient to me.",IP
39,100,Grocery,"Well the other thing of course is about the,the wine sales is that in Washington D.C. you can only buy wine until 10p.m. You can only buy liquor in grocery stores in Washington D.C. until 10pm.",SBR
39,101,Grocery," So I think I mean,I think that are customers are pretty are probably already expecting this and they dontI dont think that the crowd in D.C. goes to theand certainly goes shopping for wine in the late evening hours because they know about the restrictions and everything and I think that if we were",SBR
39,102,Grocery,"well I can see an advantage to being the only,like one of the only stores open, I also think that weif we stayed open you know past kind of these late work hours, I think we might be one of the only stores in the entire area thats still area so people arent going to expect anything, so I dont know, I just cant picture people being attracted to come out and go grocery and wine shopping much later than 7:30 or 7:30 oclock or whatever.",SBR
39,103,Grocery," I mean I guess know how you feel and you kind of feel how I feel so maybe we should move on again and restrict ourselves to our time,so",PM
39,104,Wine,"I think we covered the four issues,even if we dont have any agreement on the two.",PO
39,105,Wine,"What about the last one,the temperature?",QP
39,106,Grocery,The temperature.,MIN
39,107,Wine,"Yeah,what do you think about the grocery store?",QP
39,108,Grocery,Ill admit Im not that experienced with wines so Im not sure what the ideal temperature is for storage of,MIC
39,109,Wine,5 minutes?,OT
39,110,Grocery,Are you telling us its 5 minutes?,OT
39,111,Wine,"Okay,we know.",OT
39,112,Grocery,Great.,OT
39,113,Wine,"Yeah,and so my experience is that its you know, very low temperature gonna keep my wines you know good, and also gonna have people refreshing when they come in",SBR
39,114,Wine,"so I propose the lowest possible for the grocery store,what do you think?",OS
39,115,Grocery,"I guess for me,since Ill have a lot of my groceries in locked cases, referidgnot locked but in referidgerated cases, / I was kind of expecting that the temperature should would be a little warmer",SBR/ IP
39,116,Grocery," only,just to only to save some money cause I mean were already spending a lot of money on renovations, and were going to be, you know,",SBR
39,117,Grocery,"I dont know,if were opening, the earlier we open kinda theI, I, I would just prefer to",IP
39,118,Grocery,"cause the earlier we open the more money were already going to have to spend because its going to be summer and well have to worry about heat,heatair conditioning costs",SBR
39,119,Grocery,"so I guess I would prefer to keep the temperature a little warmer than that,",IP
39,120,Grocery," only for the sake of keeping the place,keeping the place above water in terms of the rent money",SBR
39,121,Grocery,but I do see the point for sure about the storage of the wine.,MIC
39,122,Grocery,So you said the ideal storage for storage temperature for wine is 65 degrees?,INP
39,123,Wine,"Yeah,65 degrees",IP
39,124,Grocery,"Okay,well, maybe I guess since we only have 5 minutes we should kind of work out these last issues.",PO
39,125,Wine,"Yeah,exactly.",MIC
39,126,Grocery,So,MIN
39,127,Wine,"I can you know,I agree with you hours of operation but I still think ourI know you want to grab like some people from the work, before the work, how aboutlets make that",SBR
39,128,Wine,I think 7:30 is still too early.,IP
39,129,Wine,"So I give you,give me one hour I mean before that, I mean after that so I still can attract some people who want dinner so thats 8:30 so that would be my last choice on hours of operation.",OS
39,130,Wine,"For the,Im not sure for the temperature I can, like you said, you already have some back out for the referidgerator or something so I can raise to like 2 degrees to 67.",OM
39,131,Wine,Im not sure if thats okay with you or not.,MIN
39,132,Grocery,"Well,I guess if that were the case, and wed be spending the extra money on the or what I guess I would kind of see as more money on the heating, I would at least like to have until August to open up the store.",OM
39,133,Wine,"Yeah,yeah, I can agree with you since theyeah.",RP
39,134,Wine,"Cause open time going to be you know,yeah, yeah, then we can award at least one month summer, okay.",MIC

41,3,Wine,And Im the owner of a wine store./,Grocery,Yup./,," I think we have some issues,five issues to discuss./",
41,4,Wine," Would you,where do you want to start?/",
41,5,Wine,"Well,where would you like to begin?/",
41,6,Grocery,"Lets start from,is there one, like, like the floor space./",
41,7,Wine,Okay./,," Where how did you envision this,this division?/",
41,8,Grocery,What?/,Wine,"How do you,how do you think the best place for the breakfast space is?/",
41,9,Grocery,"I,I own a grocery store, /so I may need a, I have a more variety of stuff that I need in the store./",
41,10,Grocery," I think I,I may need 60% for my store./",
41,11,Wine,So that would leave me with 40%./,Grocery,Mmhmm./,Wine,Thats a little less than I was thinking but I can make 40% work./,,So I think we can agree on that./,
41,12,Grocery,"Okay,great./",
41,13,Grocery,Thank you./,
41,14,Wine,Your welcome./,," But if I only have 40% of the floor,Im going to need to be open longer in order to make money to, to move enough product equal to what I would have if I had more floor space,/",
41,15,Wine," because you know,the more you have out, the more you sell./",
41,16,Wine," So for hours of operation,I really need to be open from 10:30 to 10:30. /",
41,17,Grocery,10:30 to 10:30./,Wine,Mmhmm. /,Grocery,"But you know,I, my store sells breakfast./",
41,18,Grocery,I need to open it to serve people breakfast/,
41,19,Grocery,and how about we open at 6:30?/,Wine,Do people really come into your grocery store for breakfast in Dupont Circle?/,Grocery,"Yes,there is./",
41,20,Grocery,"Theres fancy luxury apartments along and there is,there is a lot of office building here so people usually go to the grocery store on their way to work./",
41,21,Wine,"So Im going to be going to serving the same people as theyre leaving work,and at dinner time when they want waterwater, they want wine or after dinner drink./",
41,22,Wine,"So if we close at 6:30,thats going to kill my business effectively, since most of my sales occur after 6:30. /",
41,23,Wine,When do you get your main rush for breakfast customers?/,Grocery,"Thatll be,thatll be 7:30, I think./",
41,24,Wine," I cannot miss that,I cannot miss that part. /",
41,25,Wine,"Yeah,I have to be open until at least 9:30 in order to make any business at all,/",
41,26,Wine," because its really 8:30 to 9:30,/",,but really 8:30 to 10:30 is when I do most of my business./,
41,27,Grocery,"That isit is hard because thats,thats a really major part of my business, the breakfast./",
41,28,Wine,So that seems surprising to me because Im sure grocery store youre going to be able to sell food for lunch and dinner as well./,," So it surprises me a little bit that you feel so much that your business comes from breakfast,particularly because its a specialty shop./",
41,29,Wine,Im sure you sell a lot of prepared foods for other meals./,
41,30,Grocery,"But you know,the population, the population, the community is kind of different from the urbansurburban people./",
41,31,Wine,"Right,but if theres residential condos and more luxury housing going in the area, I think you can predict pretty safely that your dinner, dinner options are going to be much more important./",
41,32,Grocery,"Usually if people prepare dinner,they may go Safeway, these kind of grocery store, not like this kind./",
41,33,Grocery,"Our business type is breakfast,breakfast made early./",
41,34,Grocery,It is a little bit hard.,
41,35,Wine,Perhaps we should discuss another issue because I dont/,Grocery,understand each other better?/,Wine,Yeah. /,Grocery,With what/,Wine,"One of my other main concerns is going to be attracting foot traffic,because people that buy wine tend to go to nicer stores to purchase their wines,/",
41,36,Wine,so I think really remodeling the space that we have will be our best interest because were selling not just food and wine but the experience if going to go get it./,
41,37,Wine,So renovation cost is going to be very important./,
41,38,Grocery,Grocery store/,,what would you want to spend for renovation?/,Wine,"Well looking at the space after having visiting it,I would think that it would require about $30,000 worth of renovations./",
41,39,Grocery,"Wow,thats a bitthats a big moneybig bucks./",
41,40,Grocery," If you,you cost 30,000, I have 60% of the cost for./",
41,41,Grocery,whats the best you can accept for the renovation? /,Wine,"Perhaps I could go as low as 25,000 but that would be/",,"wed have to compromise on which areas of the store would get the most renovation,and the better the place looks, the better its going to be for the both of us./",
41,42,Grocery,"Okay,thats very true but do you know how ./",
41,43,Grocery,cost a little bit more so/,,for maybe we can use some cost efficient renovation?/,," Do you,can you accept 20,000?/",
41,44,Grocery," Thats the maximum I can,I can afford at this time./",
41,45,Wine,I could accept that if you are willing to make an agreement that over the next five years we would invest additional money in to complete renovations./,Grocery,"Okay,think, think about that./",
41,46,Wine,"Im sure we could manage to,if we work with efficiency but also purchase the materials we could./",
41,47,Grocery,"I dont know about five years later,that depends on the business, but I think itll be good to make plan for future,/",
41,48,Grocery,but I dont know if I really cant afford that much./,Wine,See my concern is that if the building doesnt look attractive then were not going to get the foot traffic we need/,,and in particular youre asking me to close earlier than if my hours arent attractive to customers then I need something else to drag them in./,Grocery,"Yeah,I think its true, that is true./",
41,49,Wine,And people who are coming to buy wine and liqour are also going to be buying  more of your groceries to get what they/,,"I mean,hopefully, most people arent just drinking liquor on its own./",
41,50,Grocery,"Yeah,thats also true for breakfast./",
41,51,Grocery," Yeah so,still, I cannot afford it, I know my budget./",
41,52,Grocery," Youre youre,you, you want to pay 20,000?./",
41,53,Grocery," Okay,I can make it./",
41,54,Wine," Okay,so were agreed on that./",
41,55,Grocery,Mmhmm./,Wine,"So if investing $20,000 for the renovations,we need to get open as quickly as possible so we can start, we could then gain some of that money./",
41,56,Grocery,When when were you planning to open?/,
41,57,Grocery,"I,I actually need more time to prepare and get money get the store done, ready,/",
41,58,Grocery,,so Im thinkthe best I can do is September./,
41,59,Wine,September?/,,My goodness!/,,I know that you need to order stock and make connections for suppliers/,
41,60,Wine,but thats going to cost me so much in sales/,

41,79,Grocery,10:30 is really past the breakfast time./,,Nobody/,,people are ready for lunch at that time and my customer mayI will have zero customers after 8./,Wine,"Ohhif we open in August,you know, Ill be willing to consider opening from 9:30 to 9:30 so you can catch the late breakfast crowd, because honestly, who goes to the office at 9 anymore?/",

41,88,Wine,Im sure youll be able to shift todinner and after dinner customers./,,"I mean,theres no point in me opening up at 6:30 in the morning to sell alcohol./",

41,91,Wine,"But if Iif we were to do 8:30 to 8:30,do you think you could be ready to open in July?/",
41,92,Wine,"Because again,if Im going to lose my prime hours for selling my products, I have to open as soon as possible so I wont suffer a double hit./",
41,93,Grocery,I suffer the early morning 6:30 to 8:30 customers./,,Can you can you compromise one month business?/,Wine,So open in July?/,Grocery,"I mean,open in August./",

41,98,Wine,I dont think the store would be that empty./,,"At worst,I can move my wine and spread it out a little bit more, and as your stuff comes in, we could reduce back to the floor space./",

41,100,Grocery,"and set upits very important to set up an image,to deliver the image of my store to the customers./",
41,101,Grocery,"So to have us ready,to have my stuff ready before open is very important./",
41,102,Wine,"Right,but you certainly additional staff now to help with the opening./",
41,103,Wine,"It would be an upfront investment that would pay off,makes you more, because you would be making more sales during the month of July./",
41,104,Grocery,But I cant./,,"I try,I try all my best to look for the well-trained, well-trained staff but I cannot do it right now. /",
41,105,Wine,"Then perhaps we should discuss the other remaining issue,the temperature of the store./",
41,106,Grocery,Yeah./,
41,107,Grocery,Think about what we have/,,"how long you have your lease agreement with the store,5 years, 10 years? /",

41,111,Wine,"Yes,but youre/",
41,112,Wine,Ive already agreed not to be open my highest time of profits so the store has to be open as soon as possible./,Grocery,But its one month. /,Wine,But its one month of high sales for me/,,and August is honestly not a good time to open in the D.C. area because everyone leaves the city./,,Thats the prime month for vacationing because it gets so hot and humid./,,"So really,I think it would be the best, both of our interest to open by July./  ",
41,113,Grocery,Okay./,,"I really cannot do that,its really, its really hard. I cannot do that you know?/",
41,114,Wine,"Well if I open later,it would, it would ease some of my concerns about the temperature in the store if we open in August. I may not have to worry as much about the temperature of the store for my products./",
41,115,Wine,,65 degrees is optimal for the wines that I carry./,,They tend to spoil and it detracts from the right value if not properly stored. /,Grocery,"Wow,thatssome of my products may go bad at that low degree. /",
41,116,Wine,"My goodness,its not that low!/",
41,117,Wine,You store your products in warehouses dont you?/,Grocery,Yes. /,Wine,Im sure you have produce that needs to be maintained./,Grocery,"Then,oh my gosh./",
41,118,Wine,Can you accept 67 in your store?/,Wine,I could accept 67 but Id really need to be open in July./,Grocery,This is a little bit hard./,,II wont be ready./,Wine,"Well if Im going to have to until August,Ill have to insist that the temperature be at 65./",
41,119,Grocery,Yeah./,,Thats hard./,,How important is temperature for 65 instead of 67 for you?/,Wine,Its fairly substantial./,,"You know,theres a very fine window./",
41,120,Grocery,"If its at 65,I dont have to worry about fluctuations of when people are coming in and out of the store, that would change the temperature level./",
41,121,Grocery,I can accept 67 but we would really need to open in July./,Grocery,Okay./,Wine,Can we agree on 67 and opening in July?/,Grocery," Okay,alright!/",

47,85,Grocery,But its not for yousoso your sure at least 25 thousand?/,QB
47,86,Grocery,Ok 25../,RP
47,87,Wine,25 is ok?/,QM
47,88,Grocery,ok./,MI-N
47,89,Wine,Ok great./,MI-C
47,90,Wine,Thank you./,MI-C
47,91,Wine,Ok and so that just leaves the floor space./,P1
47,92,Grocery,In general the grocery store is bigger than wine shop oror some cooler shop so/,SB-R
47,93,Grocery,my betterbest choice is 60%./,IP
47,94,Wine,60%?/,QM
47,95,Grocery,60-40./,MI-N
47,96,Wine,yea that sounds fine for to me. 40 is...is good for me./,IP
47,97,Grocery,oh really?/,QM
47,98,Wine,yea so I will be happy if we do that./,RP
47,99,Wine,Ok so we agree on 40%./,MI-C
47,100,Wine,Ok so we havewere staying open from 8:30 to 8:30. spend 25 thousand dollars on renovations. 40% for me 60% for you. 67 degrees and we open in August./,MI-N
47,101,Grocery,Ok /,MI-N
47,102,Wine,that sound good?/,QM
47,103,Grocery,good good./,MI-C
47,104,Wine,ok I guess were all set then./,MI-C
47,105,Grocery,sounds good. /,MI-C
48,0,Grocery,Hi/,MIC
48,1,Wine,HI/,MIC
48,2,Grocery,how about we first discuss the renovation costs?/,P1
48,3,Wine,I think hours is better./,P1
48,4,Wine,Cause like depends on the hours of operation that were gonna get will also determine like grand opening date./,MIN
48,5,Wine,"Well actually,renovation will be fine too./",P1
48,6,Grocery,Ok I think its best that try and keep it as low as possible/,IP
48,7,Grocery,cause i dont think it needs a lot of work./,SBR
48,8,Grocery,We should try and save our money and use it on something else./,SBR
48,9,Grocery,So I think 10 thousand dollars would work well for both of us./,OS
48,10,Wine,"Well actually,I think its better to have a nice renovated than a not renovated/",IP
48,11,Wine,because people would be attracted to how it looks on the outside./ Like you wouldnt go to some store thats not that great like./ Like people would be attracted to like lightsand fancy what you call the boards and stuff./,SBR
48,12,Wine,,,I think 30 thousand dollars to maximize the renovation costs./,IP
48,13,Wine,To seeI mean it will pay off in the long term./,SBR
48,14,Wine,But peopleif they are attracted by our decorations they will come and buy stuff./,SBR
48,15,Wine,Instead ofI mean you wouldnt go to a store thats not clean. It wouldnt give you a thought of that place might not be clean./ ,SBR
48,16,Grocery,Well I think the location helps a lot in bringing people in. So they dont really need to see something extremely fancy. Theyre going to be interested in coming./,SBR
48,17,Grocery,I think it would work better by looking nice on the outside but not over the top/,SBR
48,18,Grocery,so maybe we can bump it up to 15 /or maybe even 20 if that would work/,OS/OS
48,19,Wine,well also for the location toothat it is a nice place. You dont wanna to look worse than the other places around you in order toin order to attract customers./,SBR
48,20,Wine,So I mean I think we should decorate as much as we can on the outside and also keep it clean and organized as possible on the inside./,SBR
48,21,Wine,so Im gonna stick with 30 thousand./,OS
48,22,Grocery,really?/,QM
48,23,Wine,maybe 25 about.../,OS
48,24,Grocery,Its really pretty out of my budget to be going that high./,SBR
48,25,Grocery,I think that it would work better if we tried to cut some other costs/,SBR
48,26,Wine,25 maybe?/,OS
48,27,Grocery,Id be willing to go to 20./,OS
48,28,Wine,No./,RN
48,29,Wine,We need to go to 25./,OS
48,30,Grocery,25?/,QM
48,31,Wine,Cause it is I mean at this moment it would be a lot of money to pay at once but    Im sure its gonna payoff in the long term./,SBR
48,32,Wine,"Cause it is a nice place,people are gonna come if its attractive. More people will come by./",SBR
48,33,Grocery,Yea./,MIN
48,34,Grocery,Well I think that its not really falling apart right now./,SBR
48,35,Grocery,And if we spend too much money were not going to really be able to keep it looking nice inside./,SBR
48,36,Grocery,You know we could spend a bit more money and have like a nice opening or something like thatthat would bring more people in/,SBR
48,37,Wine,well renovation/,MIN
48,38,Grocery,you could use the money for samples you know./,SBR
48,39,Wine,"well thing is we dont,we cantwell for the groceries we can out some fast foods but howre we gonna give out the wines you know?/",SBR
48,40,Grocery,Yea well you can always do wine tasting. People do that./,SBR
48,41,Grocery,So I think 20 would be best./,OS
48,42,Grocery,You dont want to blow the budget right off./,SBR
48,43,Wine,How about we come back to that one?/,PM
48,44,Wine,Cause I wanna stick with 25./,IP
48,45,Grocery,Ok/,MIN
48,46,Wine,Things/,MIN
48,47,Wine,How about floor space then?/,QP
48,48,Grocery,yea/,MIN
48,49,Wine,because its the wine that we have and yours is groceries. You probably need more space. I dont need that much space./,INP
48,50,Wine,I want just 40%./,IP
48,51,Grocery,40%?/,QM
48,52,Grocery,Which would give me 60%?/,QM
48,53,Grocery,Ok that sounds fine./,RP
48,54,Grocery,How about the temperature?/,P1
48,55,Grocery,I kinda want it to be a warmer temperature./,IP
48,56,Grocery,Because it would keep my stuff...it would keep it better/,SBR
48,57,Grocery,and it would cost less on air conditioning./,SBR
48,58,Grocery,I dont think that you need it to be too cold because you can always use something like refrigerators if you have to have wine selling it for that day./,SBR
48,59,Grocery,And otherwise I think wine would keep fine in a warmer temperature./,SBR
48,60,Grocery,I think 73 degree would be prefect for me./,IP
48,61,Wine,Well the perfect degree for me would be 65/,IP
48,62,Wine,"because of some liquors...Not for the wine but some liquors need to to be kept at a cold,low temperature to be goodto be in good shape I guess./",SBR
48,63,Grocery,well 65 degrees would/,MIN
48,64,Wine,Could beis that...would that be to cold?/,QS
48,65,Grocery,I think it would be too cold./,SBR
48,66,Grocery,Plus it would cost a lot of money for both of us on air conditioning./,SBR
48,67,Wine,how about 67?/,OS
48,68,Grocery,67/,MIN
48,69,Grocery,maybe 69 would work better./,OS
48,70,Wine,69/,MIN
48,71,Grocery,Yea because its only about...its a 4 degree difference between both of our perfect temperatures./,PC
48,72,Wine,yea but the 4 degree could affect the wine. Thats why Im concerning./ Cause with your food some of them arewill be in the refrigerator so it wouldnt really effect the groceries./,SBR/SBR
48,73,Grocery,well most of it will be out because theyll be a lot of pastries you know and for it to be sitting out in a colder temperature. It just wouldnt make much sense because it needs to be warmer anyway.../,SBR
48,74,Grocery,"I mean with the wine you  know,you can always keep it like in a box to keep it from getting too cold. I mean all of it doesnt need to be out on the shelf that day./       ",SBR
48,75,Wine,I think 69 is ok./,RP
48,76,Wine,How about the hours of operation?/,P1
48,77,Grocery,Well I would like it to be earlier for me/,IP
48,78,Grocery,because theyre a lot of pastries that need to be sold./,SBR
48,79,Grocery,So Im thinking opening around 6:30 and then closing around 6:30./ ,IP
48,80,Wine,I think thatll would be too early/,IP
48,81,Wine,cause it is a alcoholnobody drinks alcohol around 6 o clock./,SBR
48,82,Wine,So best time for me would be 10:30 and close at 10:30./,IP
48,83,Wine,"Cause even myselfhave...i mean even if you go to theany liquor store if they close by 9 o clock no one is gonna come there,no one is gonna go there after work./",SBR
48,84,Grocery,"yea well a lot of people will be buying wine I think. And I think people who would be buying the wine will probably be coming in a little bit earlier and planning their dinner ahead,so the people who will be coming in really late will probably just, there, buy liquor anyway./",SBR
48,85,Grocery,You might not even want them in the store anyway./,SBR
48,86,Wine,yea but I think 6:30 would be too early for us./,SBR
48,87,Wine,How about 9:30?/,OS
48,88,Grocery,9:30?/,IP
48,89,Grocery,Opening at 9:30 is too earlyor too late for me still/,IP
48,90,Grocery,because people are already done with breakfast and be off at work at that time.,SBR
48,91,Grocery,I think the earliest would be 8:30./,OS
48,92,Wine,you mean the latest?/,QM
48,93,Grocery,well yeayea/,MIN
48,94,Wine,8:30yea../,MIN
48,95,Wine,"I think 8:30if we close at 8:30,I mean some people drink wine for the dinner but like were not just selling the wine were also selling liquors and stuff too./",SBR
48,96,Wine,People just passing by might just come stop by liquor or two./,SBR
48,97,Wine,9:30 will be fine. /,IP
48,98,Wine,How about this then?/,MIN
48,99,Wine,Well open at 9:30 but push up the budget to 25?/,OM
48,100,Wine,I mean 8:30./,MIN
48,101,Grocery,open at 8:30 and push the budget to 25?/,QM
48,102,Grocery,"Yea,I think that would work and then../",RP
48,103,Wine,"Ok,how about grand opening date?/",P1
48,104,Grocery,Well/,MIN
48,105,Wine,I want it to be early as possible/,IP
48,106,Wine,"so that we can just go ahead,start the business and make more money./",SBR
48,107,Grocery,"Well if were going to use the 25 thousand on the renovation costs,I think that if we had an earlier opening date then youd just be spending all the money on fixing it up as soon as possible, and paying peope a lot more money to get it taken care of too soon./",SBR
48,108,Grocery,So I think by pushing back the grand opening date well be better able to used the renovation costs money and make it as nice as possible./ ,SBR
48,109,Wine,So sometime in july/ or june?/,OS/OS
48,110,Grocery,"I think that sept,aug is better/.",IP
48,111,Wine,I think that will be too late./,IP
48,112,Wine,"July,what about july? July will be too early for you?/",OS
48,113,Grocery,July would be too early for me./,IP
48,114,Grocery,Yea and then...think about it too...the air conditioning costs.. well be saving money by having it later too./,SBR
48,115,Grocery,So overall just...either sept or aug will be saving us money. And working out a lot better./,SBR
48,116,Wine,well keeping at 69 degrees wouldnt be too much of air conditioning paying off./,SBR
48,117,Wine,What about july?/,OS
48,118,Grocery,well july is the hottest month./,SBR
48,119,Wine,July is not the hottest month. August is the hottest month./,SBR
48,120,Wine,So..and its gonna  cool off bye end of august so I dont think july is going to effect that much for the air conditioning./,SBR
48,121,Wine,"Especially if were not keeping at the lowest,65./",SBR
48,122,Wine,Were keeping it at 69 right?/,QM
48,123,Grocery,Yea/,MIN
48,124,Wine,So I dont think/,MIN
48,125,Wine,"Cause as I keep saying the faster we open,its better for both of us to go ahead and start on our business./",SBR
48,126,Grocery,I dont know./,MIN
48,127,Grocery,"Well Id rather have like,a really good Grand Opening, thatll really attract people./",SBR
48,128,Grocery,Like if we have people working on it and keep it looking nice for the first couple of months and then have a big openingI think people would be more interested and more likely to come in and check that out./,SBR
48,129,Wine,"but for august you know a lot of people go on vacations. Cause its summer. So wouldnt it be better to have more people come in on July,not August/",SBR
48,130,Grocery,well that would just mean that August sales would start to slump anyway so.. I mean/,SBR
48,131,Wine,"yea so we should bring as much as customers as we canwell thats why I was thinking,May would be better./",SBR
48,132,Wine,Like all those college students will come back from their home and want to shop too. So I was thinking May./,SBR
48,133,Wine,Well May is my best choice and thats not gonna work./,IDN
48,134,Wine,"Maybe JuneJune wouldnt be too,it wouldnt be too late either, I mean it wouldnt be too early./",OS
48,135,Wine,And August I think will be too late and most of the people will leave by that time. And most of like students and overall./,SBR
48,136,Wine,And also a lot of people go on vacation for August./,SBR
48,137,Wine,And September everybodys too busy for work to.../,SBR
48,138,Grocery,Well I think like we shouldnt worry about students because a lot of them cant even drink and I dont think theyll be spending a lot of money on really good wineor any nice groceries./,SBR
48,139,Grocery,I think we should try to focus on the people to.../,SBR
48,140,Wine,Yea the people. People in general./,SBR
48,141,Wine," Like in August,not many people will be here to shop./ I mean even myself, I wasnt here for August/",SBR
48,142,Wine,Grocery,"yea,well/",MIN
48,143,Wine,"September as I said,everybodys was busy./",SBR
48,144,Grocery,Well I dont know./,SBR
48,145,Grocery,"Like,Having it in September people would be giving off work and coming back from vacation, they might want to treat themselves more./",SBR
48,146,Grocery,"And I think just starting,like if we start in August, it might just be too much of a slump. We really want the first month and the months after that to be a big seller./",SBR
48,147,Grocery,"Especially like by opening in September,we also have the holidays afterwards and I think a lot of people would be spending a lot of money then, on parties and things like that./",SBR
48,148,Wine,Yea but theres holiday in July too/,SBR
48,149,Grocery,well I dont know./,MIN
48,150,Grocery,People dont really have a big July 4th like...fancy/,SBR
48,151,Wine,"yea but the holidays not until like,November./",SBR
48,152,Grocery,yea well I think that we should try to have it later./,IP
48,153,Wine,"I dont know,I think July./",OS

49,49,I mean among that/,"Getting all the food. Cause,a grocery store has lots of stuff/",SB-R
49,50,I mean among that/,so I would like to open as late as possible./,IP

49,55,Grocery,And you want to attract the high level clientele./,INN
49,56,Wine,so I want to know it is uhmost important to you./,QR
49,57,Grocery,"yea I think that renovation costs and how much you want to spend is definitely something that,that I can work with./",PC
49,58,Grocery,And i think that sort of goes hand in hand with when we open./,PP
49,59,Grocery,"If we want to spend a little bit more money on renovations and getting things set,we probably should open a little bit later so we can really make sure theres enough time to get everything finished before, before we open./",PP

49,61,Wine,"frankly I,I want to investigate as much as possible, you know, in my amount./",SB-R
49,62,Wine,Just my desirability is 30 thousandSo it then/ ,IP

49,66,Grocery,"Ok so,yea Im at a situation where I dont have quite as much cash to spend. So I cant spend more than 25 thousand dollars to spend/",IP
49,67,Grocery,but maybe thats something we can come back to and just sort of looking at. To make it cost effective./,PM
49,68,Grocery,"Cause they say within the first year like most,you know, businesses go out of business within the first year if you dont have a good start so..../",SB-R
49,69,Wine,"yea so...ok now I know at least what your,I mean your exportability of/",MI-N
49,70,Wine,So how about the hours of operationsits the most important thing right?/,QR
49,71,Grocery,thats important as well. /Being a grocery store I hope to be able to sell/,IR/SB-R
49,72,Wine,The right kind of/,MI-N
49,73,Grocery,donoughts and coffee; things in the mornings./,SF
49,74,Grocery,So I would prefer to be open earlier in the morning. As early as possible. And then its not as important for me to be open late in the evening./,IP
49,75,Grocery,I imagine your probably different cause people like to buy wine later at night dont they?/,IN-P
49,76,Wine,Opposite/,ID-N
49,77,Wine,I mean groceries and liquors has different kinds of stuff./,SB-R
49,78,Grocery,but most people would be buying wine for dinner right? So its not like a beer shop that theyll want it real late at night./,SB-R
49,79,Grocery,"But perhaps,to be able to buy for dinner or hors dourves./",SB-R
49,80,Grocery,So what would be the earliest time that you would be happy closing at night time?/,QB

49,84,Grocery,Personally this is quite important just../,IR
49,85,Grocery,Most people go to work at 9 o clock so I think itd be great to be open before 9 o clock in the morning/,SB-R

50,8,Wine,"Ok,so I think we have 5 different things..",PO
50,9,Grocery,Yea hrs ops..,MI-N
50,10,Wine,"That we have to decide on. Renovation costs,and floor space, temperature and Grand opening date.",PO
50,11,Wine,Are those the things that are kind of on your mind right now? ,QM
50,12,Grocery,so lets just start with the first issue.,P1
50,13,Wine,ok thats fine.,MI-C
50,14,Grocery,Alright yeaI think we only offer mainly offer breakfast products and fresh food juices...,SF
50,15,Grocery,so I think its better for me to do the operation hours early in the mornings to ..I meanlate afternoon.,IP
50,16,Wine,ok what times were you thinking? What did u have in mind?,QP
50,17,Wine,Grocery,my ideal time would be from 6:30 to 6:30pm.,IP
50,18,Wine," But,yea... The beginning time might be a little bit too early for youso",IN-P
50,19,Wine,Ok yea.,MI-N

50,21,Wine,"The shop that we have elsewhere is,is open really late in the evening and we really dont have a need, we dont get very much traffic through early in the morning.",SB-R

50,23,Grocery,so the later the more competitive you are.,IN-P
50,24,Wine,Yes.,MI-N
50,25,Wine,"Yea,definitely.",MI-N

50,28,Wine,no?,OT
50,29,Wine,ok theyre still going to be separate businesses do you think?,OT

50,31,Wine,Ok sure,MI-C
50,32,Grocery,"So,so what do you think? Any alternatives?",QP
50,33,Grocery,Wine,"yea well our...well ideally we would like to have 10:30 in the morning,10:30 at night.",IP
50,34,Grocery,Which obviously is too late for breakfast.,IN-P
50,35,Grocery,thats really too bad for me,RN

50,40,Wine,ok do you absolutely have to let see,MI-N
50,41,Grocery,"what about,8, half past 8? Till 8:30pm?",OS
50,42,Grocery,I think that might be reasonable for both of us.,MI-C
50,43,Grocery,Because its not gonna yield me the highest profits that just make it compellable.,MI-C
50,44,Grocery,To you its uh,MI-N
50,45,Wine,thats still really early for us.,RN
50,46,Grocery,oh really?,QM

50,48,Wine,"People,when people are getting off work and things, they want to stop off somewhere and grab a bottle of wine.",SB-R

50,50,Grocery,I guess were not at the two extremes in terms of hours of operations otherwise we can never reach an agreement.,ID-N
50,51,Grocery,That,Wine,well I would be willing to to,MI-N
50,52,Grocery,"10:30 is,well go on",MI-N

50,56,Grocery,Any item you want.,MI-N

50,62,Wine,Wed really like to do a complete makeover on the building and like to propose that 25 thousand dollars for the renovation costs at this point.,OS
50,63,Wine,We think that that..,MI-N
50,64,Grocery,for a little wine shop?,SBR
50,65,Wine,wellyea,MI-N
50,66,Grocery,But people are not dining in right?,SB-R
50,67,Wine,Right,MI-N
50,68,Grocery,"Theyre just going to grab a bottle and go home so/my point of view,might be reasonable to just lower it, lower the cost a little bit.",SBR/IP

50,70,Grocery,People are not sitting inside,SB-R
50,71,Grocery,And ideally you...did you say 25 thousand?,QP
50,72,Wine,Yes,MIN
50,73,Grocery,Far as Im concerned Id rather have 15 thousand.,IP
50,74,Grocery,Does that work for you?,QP
50,75,Wine,not even close.,RN
50,76,Grocery,maybeok...Yea so weve got to be compatible.,MI-C
50,77,Wine,right,MI-N
50,78,Grocery,what about 20 thousand?,OS
50,79,Wine,thats a little closer.,RN
50,80,Grocery,"20 thousand,might work...for both of us",PC
50,81,Wine,"Ok,well dont you think that if we spend more money on renovations, even if its a little small",SB-R
50,82,Grocery,"yea yea thats a good logic but as far as a grocery store is concerned,renovation costs can do some harm to our profits.",SB-R
50,83,Grocery,"Because,yea.. Cause were not getting any gain from this aspect.",SB-R
50,84,Grocery,Can you understand...because,MI-N
50,85,Wine,I understand where your coming from but at the same time ifYou would gain profit from this.,MI-C/SB-R
50,86,Wine," Because more people would come and shop in the,in the store.",SB-R
50,87,Wine,And in the long run it really does benefit both of us if we have a nicer appearance to the store.,SB-R
50,88,Grocery,so maybe I canyea.,PC
50,89,Grocery,"Yea,so 25 thousand?",OS
50,90,Wine,25?,QM
50,91,Wine,Ok.,RP
50,92,Wine,That sounds good.,MI-C
50,93,Wine,"And,I think also, if you think about, aboutwith in renovations, though if you think about how much you budget things to cost and they always end up costing a little bit more.",MI-N
50,94,Wine,I feel like if we budget 25 thousand in total and maybe go into contracts with the different people that are going to be doing the renovations and tell them maybe 20 thousand dollars and it ends up being over by 5 thousand to that  25 thousand number that we have in our heads.,MI-N
50,95,Wine,"I feel like that would be,that would be better than having a surprise cost in the end.",MI-N
50,96,Grocery,Ok.,MI-N
50,97,Grocery,but we are negotiating over the real costs.,MI-N
50,98,Wine,"Yes,yes.",MI-N
50,99,;,We are negotiating over the real costs.,MI-N
50,100,Grocery,Just a reminder to you..,MI-N

50,102,Grocery,ok that might work but that really does a little bit of harm for me.,MI-NEG
50,103,Wine,Ok I understand that.,MI-N
50,104,Grocery,Ok so,MI-N
50,105,Wine,"Ok,do you want to agree on 25 thousand then?",OS
50,106,Grocery,"25 thousand /Id prefer,I really want to go for 20 thousand.",RN/IP
50,107,Grocery,I think that might work for both of us.,MI-C
50,108,Grocery,Although I really need 10k you know.,IP
50,109,Grocery,Cause thats just fine enough for a grocery shop.,SB-R
50,110,Grocery,So Id rather spend 10k more just to accommodate you.,SB-R

50,112,Wine,I dont know.,MI-N
50,113,Wine,I really dont think so.,RN
50,114,Wine,I think that 25 is closer to what we needed.,IP

50,116,Grocery,I dont know.,MI-N
50,117,Grocery,I didnt look at the time.,PT
50,118,Wine,oh I didnt either but I think shell let us know.,PT
50,119,Grocery,Ok theres still time.,PT
50,120,Wine,Ok,MI-N
50,121,Grocery,but 25k might work for me although its not so.its far from optimal but its acceptable.,RP

50,123,Wine,do you want to decide on the 25 thousand for now?,QM
50,124,Grocery,lets move on.,PM
50,125,Wine,"Ok,so floor space is the next item on my list.",P1
50,126,Grocery,ok so how much share do you need?,QP
50,127,Wine,"at the moment we were leading towards,about 50% of the store.",IP
50,128,Grocery,50%?,QM

50,134,Grocery,did u say ideally youll prefer less than 50%?,QP
50,135,Wine,Yes,MIN
50,136,Grocery,What about 40% for you and 60% for me?,OS
50,137,Wine,that would actually be perfect for us,RP

50,145,Wine,ok temperature,P1
50,146,Grocery,do you sell cold drinks?,QS
50,147,Wine,Well yes.,SB-R
50,148,Wine,We need to have a very controlled temperature for our for the drinks.,SB-R
50,149,Wine,So right now were looking at 67 degrees.,IP
50,150,Grocery,67?,RN
50,151,Grocery,Thats a bit too low for us.,IP
50,152,Grocery,Because you know were serving bread and cakes. Theyre well preserved in the normal temperatures. Like room temperature.,SB-R
50,153,Grocery,So what would that be?,MI-N
50,154,Wine,probably 70 yea.,MI-N
50,155,Grocery,so around 70.,MI-N
50,156,Grocery,Ok so which one do you prefer?,QP
50,157,Wine,definitely we would prefer something a little colder than that so..,IP
50,158,Grocery,ok what about 69 degrees?,OS
50,159,Wine,69 is ok but not,MIN
50,160,Grocery,"its going to cost me some cost but,but I can do that",PC
50,161,Wine,but we also have to figure the cost of heating into this. So if we have a lower heating costs by lowering the temperature.,SB-R
50,162,Grocery,oh this isthis all year around?,QS

53,17,Wine,"yea,yea",MI-C
53,18,Grocery,so lets get started?,PO
53,19,Grocery,"So,well I think we have same issue we need to settle down.",PO
53,20,Grocery,"So which one do you prefer to discuss first. I mean,among 5 options, hour of operation, renovation cost, and floor space, temperature. Which one do you want to talk about first?",PO
53,21,Wine,OkIm happy to go with hrs ops first if you are,P1
53,22,Grocery,Yea.,MI-N
53,23,Grocery,Hours of operations.,P1
53,24,Grocery,OK.,MI-N
53,25,Grocery,I would like to discuss first.,PO
53,26,Grocery,"That would,that would be great.",MI-C
53,27,Wine,ok,MI-N
53,28,Grocery,"so you know I run a grocery store so I want to sell coffee,cookies and stuff.",SF
53,29,Grocery,"So I would likeI prefer the hours is 6:30am,6:30pm.",IP
53,30,Grocery,What is your opinion?,QP
53,31,Wine,"Well,its I think on this one we sort of havewere at opposite extremes.",ID-N
53,32,Wine,"Because Im,Im in the business of selling wines and liquor so its, its in my interest to want to be open as late for people shopping for parties or what have you.",SB-R
53,33,Wine,"So my,my preferred option would be 10:30am to 10:30 pm.",IP
53,34,Wine,"However I meanI dont,I dont think its reasonable for me to ask you to open that late. Because I understand you wantyou want to sell coffee to people before they get to work.",IN-P
53,35,Wine,Right?,MI-N
53,36,Grocery,yea.,MI-N
53,37,Grocery,"Well personally you see I prefer to open the store as early as possible,",IP
53,38,Wine,sure sure,MI-C
53,39,Grocery,"you know no body will drink coffee after 6:30,you know, in evening.",SB-R
53,40,Grocery,So ..whatwhat is best can youlike you can offer.?,QP
53,41,Wine,"Well what I would suggest again,cause I think...if, if, if you, if you are interested in selling coffee to people before they get to work or snacks or what have youpeople getting lunch before they get to workif, if you were to open at 8:30 that would  and and remember youre your right at Dupont Circle right? I mean, thats where, thats where were were going to be.",OS
53,42,Wine,"So people have,I would say probably have time when they get off the metro to, you know, to get off and grab a cup of coffee before they get to work. If, if we opened at 8:30.",SB-R
53,43,Wine,Does that sound reasonable to you?,QP
53,44,Grocery,"Well,I mean yea, it sounds reasonable /but, you know. 8:30, most of people they they have already, you know, in office so",MI-C/SB-R
53,45,Wine,"Yea,you think so?",QS
53,46,Grocery,"WellYea so,I think probably they would, they would not stop by my, my store, you know, to buy a cup of coffee.",SB-R
53,47,Grocery," But you know,I mean, I think 6:30pm close, would close the store is too much for you.",IN-P
53,48,Grocery,"I mean obviously,you know, people used to buy beer afterin the evening.",MI-C
53,49,Grocery,"So maybe we,we can get make a compensation.",PC
53,50,Grocery,We open at like 7:30?,OS
53,51,Wine,Well Im open to that.,RP
53,52,Wine,Im open to that if we can talk about some of the other issues that are important to me.,PX
53,53,Wine,"Why dont we say right nowcould,could we say that at the moment that were are open to considering either 7:30 or 8:30 for the time being?",PO
53,54,Wine,And let...lets talk about some of these other things too so we can come back to that?,PM
53,55,Grocery,ok so you mean conditional,PO
53,56,Wine,I mean...yea Im just saying lets talk about some of the other ones and see where we are.,PM
53,57,Grocery,ok thats like a good idea,MI-C
53,58,Wine,what should we talk about next?,P1
53,59,Grocery,the next?,QM
53,60,Grocery,We couldwell maybe we could talk about the floor space?,P1
53,61,Wine,sure,MI-C
53,62,Grocery,yea?,MI-N
53,63,Grocery,"So..So I mean,since you run liquor store, you dont need too much space.",SB-R
53,64,Grocery,I meanI mean this is my thought...ok?,MI-N
53,65,Grocery,ImIm  kind of selling coffee and something so I have to make a little bit of spacemore space for customers to take a break.,SB-R
53,66,Grocery,But people used to buy liquor like a walk in and walk out.,SB-R
53,67,Grocery,So I would say 640% for you and 60% for me and... That reasonable or?,OS
53,68,Wine,"that,that, that sounds completely reasonable to me.",RP
53,69,Grocery,yea yea.,MI-N
53,70,Grocery,So,MI-N
53,71,Wine,"I mean,that, thats pretty much what I figured I would want to have.",IP
53,72,Wine,That I think is  right about where I need to be to put my inventory out. And its pretty much exactly like you say.,MI-C
53,73,Wine,"So 40% for me and 60% for youthat sounds great,great to me.",RP
53,74,Grocery,ok that would be great.,MI-C
53,75,Grocery,Yea,MI-N
53,76,Wine,thats...thats one solved,MI-C
53,77,Grocery,I think we solved one.,MI-C
53,78,Grocery,Now whats next? We want o talk or discuss.,P1
53,79,Wine,LetsOh gosh.,MI-N
53,80,Wine,Lets talk about the renovation costs.,P1
53,81,Wine,And heres heres what Im thinking here. Im defiantly open to hearing what you have to say.,MI-C
53,82,Wine," As Im looking at the space it doesnt look like its in great shape to me.  I thinkitll probably need a fair amount of work to get it in order. And you know,not not just for, you know, you know our own safety and well being.",SB-R
53,83,Wine,I think its probably the case you and I would probably do more business if we had an attractive store front.,SB-R
53,84,Grocery,Exactly,MI-C
53,85,Wine,"Yea So Im,Im of the opinion that it will take about 30 thousand to...to get the place in good working order and make it look attractive.",IP
53,86,Wine,"And thats,thats jut what Im throwing out there so Id be happy to hear what your thinking.",MI-C
53,87,Grocery,well I think 30 thousand dollars is a little bita lot for me.,IP
53,88,Wine,little bit high?,QP
53,89,Grocery,"I mean I,so for the grocery store...I I I I dont really think I need to put that huge amount of money to renovate stuff.",SB-R
53,90,Grocery,"So I would like to,you know, put some amount to train my employees /soits30 thousand is a little bita lot.",SB-E/IP
53,91,Grocery,But I think if I ask like10 thousand?,OS
53,92,Grocery,"It,thats too much for you because. I mean I understand you you run a business well you bring a lot of customers.",ESbr
53,93,Wine,Right,MI-N
53,94,Grocery,"Then we basically,we both have a lot to benefit.",MU
53,95,Grocery,"So maybe can we just,you know. Leave this, with open hours operation and then we can talk about temperature?",PM
53,96,Wine,Alight.,MI-N
53,97,Wine,What what are you thinking about temperature?,QP
53,98,Grocery,"I mean,I meanfor me the temperaturewell you know the lower temperature will mean too much cost right?",SB-R
53,99,Grocery,Because,MI-N
53,100,Wine,because of the air conditioning??,QS
53,101,Grocery,"air condition,for both you and me.",SB-R
53,102,Wine,right,MI-N
53,103,Grocery,"so I would say we just chose the,the highest temperature so thats 7..",IP
53,104,Wine,so your thinking 73?,QP
53,105,Grocery,"because its,its comfortable enough for the customers and, you know, we do not have to spend too much cost.",SB-R
53,106,Grocery,"Electrical bill,you knowSo thats my concern.",SB-R
53,107,Grocery,Im open to,MI-C
53,108,Wine,"Well,well and Im, you know, certainly.",MI-N
53,109,Wine,Im concerned about the electrical bill as well.,MI-C
53,110,Wine,"One of one of my concerns though is I have several wines and liquors that need to be stored at low temperature. That they,their, when theyre stored cooler, they, theyll preserve better. Theyll theyll keep longer; theyll keep their flavor and their quality much better.",SB-R
53,111,Wine," So I think here heres another on where you know it maybe thatits preferable for me to have the temperature as low as possible but you know...and again I think...I think here,low as possible, for, for us, would mean 65 degrees.",IP
53,112,Wine,And this is another issue where I dont...Im not interested in keeping it super super cold,IR
53,113,Wine,"because its,you know, your right, its expensive and its probably not as comfortable.",MI-C
53,114,Wine,65 I think people would have goosebumps when theyre walking in.,MI-C
53,115,Grocery,yea butwell you thinkthe problem is 65 is a little bit cold for customers.,SB-R
53,116,Wine,yea yea I agree completely,MI-C
53,117,Grocery,working freezer,SB-R
53,118,Wine,yea yea right,MI-N
53,119,Grocery,But think about it.,MI-N
53,120,Grocery,"Say,73 and 65 basically, its for the...for the storage of food It doesnt make too much difference.",SB-R
53,121,Grocery,"But for the feeling,comfortablethat do make...that make a huge difference if they dont feel comfortable they will not come in anymore.",SB-R
53,122,Wine,"right.. I think that it will...however,it will probably make a difference for our liquors if if, you know, if they end up being of poor quality, people wont buy them then. So Im ImIm Ill tell you Ill tell you what Im thinking then.",SB-R
53,123,Wine,"I would say that,you know, I would I would prefer to have it at 67 degrees but 69 degrees would be do able for me.",OS
53,124,Wine,Does that sound like a reasonable..?,QP
53,125,Grocery,"well if you consider 71,69they only have 2 Fahrenheit difference. That doesnt make too much difference for your storage food. Think about it.",SB-R
53,126,Grocery,"You will run acing for a longer time which means you pay the bill more. I mean this is a long period. Were talking about,like, you know, once we settle down this...its its going to be always there.",SB-R
53,127,Grocery,But for your beer and stuff you can maybe circulate it quickly in small amount?  But the bill you cannot change it anymore.,SB-R
53,128,Grocery,But this is definitely my concern for this one so...yea. and 73 is best for me,IP

53,130,Wine,"yea I hear,I definitely hear what your saying.",MI-C
53,131,Wine,"But I the investment in my stock...the,the wines and liquor that I sellis frankly...is worth a lot more for me than the electrical bill. And Im willing to put up with that cost of the electricity bill to ensure that I give my customers a high quality product.",SB-R
53,132,Grocery,"yea but,does that really make difference? Only 2 Fahrenheit?",SB-R
53,133,Grocery,Wine,"well again,Im telling you that, it would be...the optimal temp for me would be 65.",IP
53,134,Grocery,"so I would,I would, that would be 6 degrees difference if were to go to 71 from where its best for me.",SB-R
53,135,Grocery,"If we go to 69,Im probably sacrificing a little bit in quality but Im willing to make that sacrifice for our customers.",OS

54,4,Grocery,nice to meet you,MIC
54,5,Wine,I guess we have to come to an agreement if were going to be sharing the space in terms of how were going to set up our store.,MIC
54,6,Grocery,yea,MIC
54,7,Wine,when are we going to start?,PO
54,8,Grocery,from the first item?,P!
54,9,Wine,"Well do you want to first,before we work out the other stuff, take care of the part like in terms of how much space we each want?",P!
54,10,Wine,"And then,because thats going to be pretty crucial to how we manage to go about renovating the store and also deciding on when were going to open it.",MIN
54,11,Wine,Because it might take us different amounts of time depending on how much space we each have.,MIN
54,12,Grocery,"How about,do you mind telling me about your situation so that I can have a comprehensive understanding?",QS
54,13,Wine,Sure. Sure!,MIC
54,14,Wine,Im actually going to be in charge of selling wine in the store and ..so we obviously dont need as much space for our product as a grocery store would for selling high scale groceries. So I was thinking that maybe 40% of the store could be devoted to wine and 60% could be devoted to groceries?,SF/SBR/IP
54,15,Wine,,"What do you think about that. Or how do you,how do you feel about that?",QP
54,16,Grocery,"Well for me,because you know like the groceries, we have a lot of items we need to show.",SBR
54,17,Grocery,So the more we can get the better.,IP
54,18,Wine,ok thats fine.,MIC
54,19,Wine,So how much would you like?,QP
54,20,Grocery,Mywell I think its 60%.,IP
54,21,Wine,ok.,MIN
54,22,Wine,That sounds good then.,RP
54,23,Wine,So Ill take 40 and you can have 60.,MIN
54,24,Wine,"Ok,so that gives us an idea of how..maybe how much its going to cost us to go about renovating the space. I dont know how you feel about how it exists right now. ",P1
54,25,Grocery,"okwe just have somewe just only need someexternal and some interior work. We dont need to send as much money on the renovations yet. So my situation,Id like to spend no more than 10 thousand dollars.",IP
54,26,Grocery,Wine,"Ok,well 10 thousand dollars is not going to get us very much in terms of return customers.",SBR
54,27,Grocery,"It might,it might be helpful in the long term if we spend a little bit more upfront and maybe that will help us in the long term.",SBR
54,28,Grocery,How about your ideal renovation costs?,QP
54,29,Wine,"I mean,I, I think that if we spend maybe double the amount to 20 thousand that might pay off in the long run.",IP
54,30,Grocery,Ok no problem.,RP
54,31,Wine,Ok?,QM
54,32,Grocery,"Yea. because I think,you know, the floor space, will be actually almost like 50-50.",MIC
54,33,Wine,Sure ok.,MIC
54,34,Grocery,that will be fine.,MIC
54,35,Wine,and especially its easier to do it upfront than down the line.,MIC
54,36,Wine,"Ok,what should we discuss next?",P1
54,37,Grocery,"I think the,I think the big problem is the hours of operations.",P1
54,38,Grocery,"I can imagine that you prefer the late hours because most customers will buy in the early morning. But for me,because we sell all the breakfast items..",IDN
54,39,Wine,Ok so we may want to reach an agreement on that because we obviously have to be open at the same time.,MIN
54,40,Wine,"I,yea.. I think the later hrs will be too late in order to possibly effect your business and.",SBR
54,41,Wine,"But at the same time if people are coming in the later to purchase wine,they might also be influenced to get items from your store as well.",MIC
54,42,Wine,So I guess how early do you want to open in the morning?,QP
54,43,Grocery,"My ideal situation is,I need to open at 6:30 till 6:30pm.",IP
54,44,Grocery,But I know this is to early for you.,INN

54,46,Wine,Well 8:30 would be ideal,RP
54,47,Wine,"cause then your getting the get the end of the people coming in for breakfast as well as the wine between people that will be coming in to buy stuff for lunch as well as the people coming in to buy stuff for dinner.

54,49,Wine,"ok,can we talk about something else then cause were..",PM
54,50,Grocery,sure,MIN
54,51,Wine,ok I guess the next thing thats going to be pretty important is when were going to open the store.,P1
54,52,Wine,And that I think depends on how long it takes us to renovate it.,MIN
54,53,Wine,I guess what are your priorities in terms of when you wan to open it?,QP
54,54,Grocery,Id prefer to have the grand opening date the later the better.,IP
54,55,Wine,okbecause it will take you,MIN
54,56,Grocery,yea because it will,MIN
54,57,Wine,"ok,we actually have our wine in storage right now.",SBR
54,58,Wine,I was hoping for may but it sounds like your looking onwards July or August?,OS/OS
54,59,Grocery,My ideal time would be September.,IP
54,60,Wine,Ok,MIN
54,61,Grocery,So how about August?,OS
54,62,Wine,"I guess if were able toI mean I would,I would be ok with opening in august if, if maybe you would consider going a little bit later in terms of the daily operation time.",PP
54,63,Wine,"So if we,if we, if we open at 8:30 instead of 7:30 or 6:30.",OM
54,64,Wine," I,I would be ok with, because Im hoping for money right because I already have a lot of stuff in storage.",SBR
54,65,Grocery,"As I mentioned that,because we need to import the items, I think I can sacrifice the hours.",MIC
54,66,Grocery,"So if you are fine with August,the opening, it will be great.",RP
54,67,Grocery,These things are more important for you..,MIC
54,68,Wine,for you..,MIN
54,69,Grocery,for me.,MIN
54,70,Wine,sure ok.,RP
54,71,Wine,"If we can,if we can open the store on a daily basis later in the morning, I would be more than happy to accommodate you.",MIC
54,72,Wine,Because your success is somewhat dependent on my success as well and vice versa.,MU
54,73,Grocery,"Ok,so, I can guarantee that we...well 6:30 is out.",MIN
54,74,Wine,"ok that,thats good.",MIC
54,75,Wine,Cause theres no way I would be selling wine at 6:30.,SBR
54,76,Grocery,yea I know.,MIN
54,77,Grocery,Its impossible.,MIN
54,78,Wine,lets see,MIN
54,79,Grocery,We belong to the same corporation.,MU
54,80,Wine,Exactly.,MIC

54,82,Wine,for both of us,MU
54,83,Grocery,I agree,MIC

57,15,Wine,Ok.,MI-N
57,16,Wine," and for me selling wine,alcohol, its better for me to stay up open later.",IP
57,17,Wine,So maybe we can come to a compromise on the hours.,PC
57,18,Wine,My preference is to open at 10:30 and close at 10:30.,IP

57,32,Grocery,How we think about this,QM

57,34,Wine,,
57,35,Grocery,I think its better 7:30 am through and 67 degrees.,OM
57,36,Grocery,So how do you think about this?,QM
57,37,Wine,I think that 7:30 is too early to close for me,IP
57,38,Wine,cause for wine sales we really need to be open later.,SB-R
57,39,Wine,But lets lets talk about some other categories and see what else,PM
57,40,Grocery,Yea,MI-N
57,41,Wine," Are you,what kind of floor space are you interested in occupying?",QP

57,43,Wine,Ok,MI-N

57,47,Grocery,yea,MI-N
57,48,Wine,Ok that works out well cause I was looking at 40% as what I would want.,MI-C
57,49,Wine,"And what about renovation costs for,for wine sales its really imp that the atmosphere that a customer is in to purchase wine is is nicer.",IR
57,50,Wine,"So Im think about investing 30 thousand into the space,the renovation costs.",IP
57,51,Wine,What is you priority as far as?,QP
57,52,Grocery,yea for the grocery store I do not care much about thehow the store looks,SB-R

57,55,Grocery,"yea,I couldyea. So, for the 15 thousand? what do you think about this?",OS
57,56,Grocery,Wine,lets see.,MI-N
57,57,Grocery,"Well I mean looking at,I was looking towards 30 thousand for investing so maybe we could go to 25.",OS

57,63,Grocery,Oh so what is the hour of operation now?,QP
57,64,Wine,"I think,I mean Id likemy preference is 10:30 to 10:30",IP
57,65,Wine,but maybe we could do 20 thousand in renovation costs and do 9:30 to 9:30.,OM
57,66,Grocery,but you mentioned 8:30 before.,MI-NEG
57,67,Wine,"if,if you know, we could make certain compromises on these issues.",PC

57,70,Grocery,Great,MI-C
57,71,Wine,And what are you thinking about your opening date?,QP

57,74,Grocery,Would you be able to open on June 1st?,OS

57,79,Wine,welllets see.,MI-N
57,80,Grocery,lets see the temperature.,P1
57,81,Wine,if you could agree to keep the temp at 65 I could move my opening date to July 1st.,OM
57,82,Wine,Which would still give me a lot of the end of summer sales,SB-R
57,83,Grocery,"So 65 is way too low for,for me.",IP
57,84,Grocery," Because I have to pay the extra air conditioning costs to keep the low degree,low temp so",SB-R
57,85,Grocery,My 1st preference is 73 degree,IP

57,88,Wine,June 1st and 67 degrees?,OM

58,24,Grocery,"Yea,and then we can probably, you know compromise in the interest of each other.",PP
58,25,Wine,sure,MIN
58,26,Grocery,ok so which of these is most important for you?,QR
58,27,Wine,Looks like.,MIN
58,28,Wine,I think it would be the renovation costs.,IR
58,29,Grocery,renovation costs.,MIN
58,30,Wine,what would your most important be?,QR
58,31,Grocery,"for me,I would say...Well Ive go two. Yea for me hours of operations and grand opening date would be kind of important.",IR
58,32,Wine,Ok,MIN
58,33,Grocery,So why would the renovation costs be most important to you?,QS
58,34,Wine,I just believe its very important to present you know a very attractive looking store which would likeon entering the store,SBR
58,35,Grocery,"Ok,yea I guess the expectations are a bit high for selling wineyour projecting that through, like and impression of classI see.",MIC
58,36,Wine,yea yea,MIN
58,37,Grocery,I see.,MIN
58,38,Wine,ok and why do you say grand opening date? Why is that very important?,QS
58,39,Grocery,"So the one reason is that I might be importing from like other countries and it will take some time to actually ship all the,the material.",SBR
58,40,Grocery,And also I would like to make sure we have enough time to train and hire good employees and have enough time to train them.,SBR
58,41,Grocery,Actually that would be pretty important for you too I would suppose.,INP
58,42,Wine,Sure,MIN
58,43,Grocery,for me it would be best to start as late as possible which would be like Sept 1st.,IP
58,44,Wine,Ok Im thinking a little bit earlier on that,IP
58,45,Wine,"but Im able to,to compromise on that issues.",PC
58,46,Wine,"Would you...I was just think hereso renovation costs,thats my important as grand opening date is for you.",IR
58,47,Wine,"Renovation costs,I was thinking of spending 30 thousand.",IP
58,48,Grocery,ok and less than that would be too little for you?,QP
58,49,Wine,"less than that,yea I feel it wouldnt be what Im looking for in the store.",IP
58,50,Grocery,ok.,MIN
58,51,Grocery,"So for me,since food like poultry kind of thing that Im doing...its not that much of a cost actually, decorate the store and all that",SBR
58,52,Grocery,So the lower the better.,IP
58,53,Grocery,"But if you could give me the god for Sept 1st,I could give you 30 thousand I suppose.",OM
58,54,Wine,that works for me.,RP
58,55,Grocery,yea?,MIN
58,56,Wine,sure.,MIC
58,57,Wine,Thatll be fine.,MIC
58,58,Grocery,ok.,MIN
58,59,Wine,grand opening will be sept 1st.,MIN
58,60,Wine,"Thats great man,that sounds neat.",MIC
58,61,Wine,That was a major one.,IR
58,62,Wine,Renovations there...,MIN
58,63,Wine,"Ok,you put hours of operations as important?",QR
58,64,Grocery,yea so the things that we have a lot of breakfast stuff to sell like coffee and then like pastries and like all those things.,SBR
58,65,Grocery,"I mean,for those thing you actually cant sell them raw of course and have to be made in the morning.",SBR
58,66,Wine,You have to get the,MIN
58,67,Grocery,"Exactly,the business man and all of those people.",SBR
58,68,Grocery,So for that reason it would be ideal for us to start the store at 6:30.,IP
58,69,Grocery,Might end up being a little too early for you but,INP
58,70,Wine,"the issue,issue there is that, you know, were selling wine and liquor and our major clientele would want it open later.",SBR
58,71,Grocery,is that true though?,QS
58,72,Wine,yea yea,MIN
58,73,Wine,I mean people people usually arent drinking wine at 6 oclock in the morning.,SBR
58,74,Grocery,oooh right!,MIC
58,75,Wine,you know.,MIN
58,76,Wine,"So theyre going to want to be purchasing something for the evening and,most would want to, get it after work and then late into the night.",SBR
58,77,Grocery,"yea I see,thats interesting actually.",MIC
58,78,Grocery,Cause I used to have a little different idea.,SBR
58,79,Grocery,To offer themIt might actually be kind of a nice thing if you could actually go to a wine store and buy a little bit of wine and then like afterwards you could go straight to a party. And bring the wine too.,SBR
58,80,Grocery,"You dont wan to waste time buying wine you know,after work.",SBR
58,81,Grocery,"You might,dont want to be late for the party.",SBR
58,82,Wine,"True,but, I, I know what you mean by that.",MIC
58,83,Wine,"But sometimes,you know, early in the morning and you really dont have time to take the time buying wine.Your trying to get ready for work, trying to make sure your going to get to work on time",SBR
58,84,Wine,Grocery,Oh I see,MIC
58,85,Wine,You wouldnt really want to be thinking aboutoh what do I want to bring to this party in the evening and you rather just rather stop on the way.,SBR
58,86,Grocery,right.,MIN
58,87,Grocery,Well sine were doing this together...I dont know.,MU
58,88,Grocery,"I was thinking it may be a nice thing if they can drop by our store,have a little breakfast and then during that time they can think about, well maybe I have some time now so why not get some wine for the party after work.",SBR
58,89,Grocery,"I mean,I think thats kind of a novel idea that other wine stores would have never explored.",SBR
58,90,Grocery,Its a very new thing that we can do together because of the nature of our business.,SBR
58,91,Grocery,I dont know if you think that..,MIN
58,92,Wine,are you willing to compromise at all on this issue,QB
58,93,Wine,or is it pretty much 6:30 to 6:30 is all it has to be,Grocery,yea..,IB
58,94,Wine,"what,what do you think on...say temperature",QP
58,95,Grocery,"yea so for ours,temperature is not that important",IR
58,96,Grocery," because of...I mean,I not like our products get bad if the temperature is high.",MIN
58,97,Grocery,"So I could go,I would say the higher the better.",IP
58,98,Grocery,But I can imagine that actually the temperature is pretty important for your business.,INP
58,99,Wine,"yea,we actually, we have some wine we need to store at a lower temperature.",SBR
58,100,Wine,so it would be best at like 65 degrees would be the ideal..,IP
58,101,Grocery,Right,MIN
58,102,Wine,ideal temperature for the wine.,MIN
58,103,Grocery,"ok yea,so if you could actually give me the hours  of operations, 6:30 to 6:30 then Id be happy to go down to 65 degrees for temperature.",OM
58,104,Wine,Could you do 7:30 to 7:30?,OM
58,105,Grocery,"7:30,Im think maybe might be7:30..",MIN
58,106,Wine,maybe 7:30 to 7:30 and then 67 degrees.,OM
58,107,Wine,Would that work for you or?,MI-N
58,108,Wine,Could you compromise on that?,PC
58,109,Grocery,"67 degrees,would 69 be too high for your wine preservation?",OM
58,110,Wine,a little high,IP
58,111,Grocery,"ok..yea,because its",MIN
58,112,Wine,do you want move on to floor spacemaybe we can,PM
58,113,Grocery,yea yea thats a good idea.,MIC
58,114,Wine,well get the last one and then see what we can do..,PO
58,115,Grocery,I would imagine that you guys might need a little more space than we do.,INN
58,116,Grocery,I dont know Im just guessing.,MIN
58,117,Wine,"we actually,you know, feel kind of badwe dont really need a whole lot of space.",IP
58,118,Grocery,Oh,MIN
58,119,Wine,Are you looking for a lot of space?,QP
58,120,Grocery,I was thinking like 60% would be like ideal.,IP
58,121,Wine,So you want 60% of the floor space?,QP
58,122,Grocery,"yea if we could get it,thatd be great.",MIC
58,123,Wine,"Ok,well give you 60% for the floor space. Then, then I get 40%.",OS
58,124,Grocery,oh thats right.,MIC
58,125,Grocery,Yea exactly.,MIC
58,126,Wine,"so you get,you get 60 and I get 40?",QM
58,127,Grocery,yea yea yea.,MIN
58,128,Grocery,"Is that,is that really good enough for you?",QP
58,129,Wine,"thats,thats great for me.",RP
58,130,Grocery,"ok yea I guessYea,I didnt really think about the fact that you can start...be comfortable with..",MIN
58,131,Wine,"yea so you dont,you need, you want more of the floor space?",QP
58,132,Grocery,no 60% is perfect for me.,IP
58,133,Grocery,Yea I mean..,MIN
58,134,Wine,"you need more,you need more space than us cause you probably have lot of bread and",INP
58,135,Grocery,yea and having too much space is not really good,IP
58,136,Wine,yea,MIN
58,137,Grocery,60% is perfect.,MIC
58,138,Wine,we still have hours of operations and temperature.,PO
58,139,Grocery,right.,MIN
58,140,Grocery,"So...for the temperature,yea 65 degrees would be fine.",IP
58,141,Wine,65?,QM
58,142,Grocery,"yea,that that was the best for you right?",QP
58,143,Wine,is there a reason it shouldnt be that cold?,QS
58,144,Wine,Would some of your food be going bad?,QS
58,145,Wine,Im trying to,MIN
58,146,Grocery,"yea,its possible.",SBR
58,147,Grocery,"73 degrees,thats supposed to be good enough",IP
58,148,Grocery,and thats definitely less costly.,SBR
58,149,Wine,"I guess,the cost for the air conditionereverythings coming into play.",SBR
58,150,Grocery,"rightbut like I said,Id be happy to go down to 65",OS
58,151,Wine,"yea I meanyou know,trying to be nice here.",MIC
58,152,Wine,"And you gave the renovation costs,you were very nice aboutand that was high.",MIC
58,153,Wine,"Im willing to sacrifice somewhat on the air conditioning I mean,theres probably another way.",PC
58,154,Grocery,right..,MIN
58,155,Wine,we could probably do 67 degrees.,OS
58,156,Wine,Is that ok with you?,MIN
58,157,Grocery,I mean like I said the higher the better for me  ,IP
58,158,Grocery,but for me the hours of operations.,IR
58,159,Wine,"you,you really need that 6:30 to 6:30 to get the people in there..?",QS
58,160,Grocery,"Yea,to be competitive to other stores and all thatits kind of important to",SBR
58,161,Wine,"Let me.. you think,you think if we open at 6:30, that benefits the wine sales?",QS
58,162,Grocery,"yea I think,I actually think that too.",SBR
58,163,Grocery,And if we start at 7:30 that would probably not give them enough time to actually shop for wine. Which would actually sacrifice my brand new idea.,SBR
58,164,Grocery,They can either eat a little breakfast then shop for wine.,CS
58,165,Wine,youll have to kind ofalmost market.,SBR
58,166,Wine,"Say you knowbefore people leave youll have to make a pitch,you know, say do you need any wine for later?...",CS
58,167,Grocery,yea,MIN
58,168,Wine,like that.,MIN
58,169,Wine,Try and get them to,MIN
58,170,Grocery,thats true.,MIN
58,171,Wine,I mean youll have to kind of work with me and almost direct them over to my side,SBR
58,172,Grocery,oh yea,MIN
58,173,Wine,and say do you need something for the evening?,MIN
58,174,Grocery,"yea yea,thats a good idea.",MIC
58,175,Grocery,And thats totally a new market.,MIC
58,176,Wine,Are you focusing on brunches more than dinner food?,QS
58,177,Grocery,Yea a lot of our products are like breakfasts kind of stuff and weve got the only kind of sandwiches.,SBR
58,178,Grocery," Since the majority of the stuff is breakfast,thats like the, the source of our profits,",SBR
58,179,Grocery,its kinda important to buy as early as possible.,SBR
58,180,Wine,ok.,MIN
58,181,Grocery,but do you think that the closing at 6:30 would actually harm your business?,QS
58,182,Wine,"it,it, it would a little bit, I mean",SBR
58,183,Grocery,would you think that the people after work would want to drop by,SBR
58,184,Wine,"yea Im thinkingbut you know,6:30people would...yea",SBR
58,185,Grocery,"in the office,trying to get people in thereyou know might want to beback home by 7 pm anyway",SBR
58,186,Wine,sure sure.,MIN
58,187,Grocery,For dinner,SBR
58,188,Wine,For dinner.,MIN

58,190,Grocery,right.,MIN

58,192,Wine,If you can get the hours of operations?,QM
58,193,Grocery,Yea,MIN
58,194,Wine,Thats fine with me,MIC
58,195,Wine,so 6:30 to 6:30 and then I get 65 degrees?,OM

58,206,Grocery,"oh great,thanks",MIC
58,207,Wine,kind of productive.,MIC
58,208,Wine,Guess we work together well.,MIC
58,209,Wine,"Its good when you can kinda,you know, take multiple things into consideration.",MIC
58,210,Grocery,"right yea,yea.",MIC
58,211,Grocery,Thats what I thought.,MIC
58,212,Wine,"ok so we done,we leave?",OT
59,0,Grocery,Ok my names Ed,MIC
59,1,Wine,good.,MIC
59,2,Wine,Nice to meet you,MIC
59,3,Grocery,Nice to meet you.,MIC
59,4,Grocery,So whats your name?,MIC
59,5,Wine,my names Baining.,MIC
59,6,Wine,OK,MIC
59,7,Grocery,So you are I imagine the owner of the wine store thats going in next door.,MIC
59,8,Grocery,Ok.,MIN
59,9,Grocery,So you wanna dive right into it?,PO
59,10,Wine,sure.,MIC
59,11,Grocery,"Ok,so whats your first choice for hours of operation?",QP
59,12,Wine,well since were combining two differentgrocery store and a wine shop,SF
59,13,Wine,and the area of operations is Dupont Circle where a lot of walk ins and tourists and people walk around and a safe place for the working in late night so.,SBR
59,14,Wine,"Since this would be a quality store and our store can open till late...like till between 11 and 11:30,",IP
59,15,Wine,so that well have more traffic and have more people coming in to the store late night. ,SBR
59,16,Grocery,ok I definitely hear what your say,MIC
59,17,Grocery," but we get a lot,a lot, a lot of breakfast, breakfast business.",SBR
59,18,Grocery,"We sell you know pancakes,breakfast stuff like that.",SBR
59,19,Grocery," We actually have a little deli if I remember correctly,little deli and sell a lot of breakfast stuff.",SBR
59,20,Grocery,So we have to be open for the breakfast crowd. Have to be open for the breakfast crowd.,IP
59,21,Grocery,Wine,so what time do you think would be preferable?,QP
59,22,Grocery,Grocery,well the best time for me would be 6:30 am to 6:30 pm,IP
59,23,Grocery,but I understand thats a little bit late for you.,INP
59,24,Grocery,Lets look at it this way.,MIN
59,25,Grocery,Youre a high class wine store right?,MIN
59,26,Grocery," Your going to be selling to people.. the whole concept behind this would be,you know, people come in to buy stuff for making dinner buy a couple of nice bottles of wine, go home, make dinner.",MIN
59,27,Grocery,Reality.. I would imagine the traffic that your going to get in the night is not the traffic you want.,MIN
59,28,Grocery,Were an upscale store right?,MIN
59,29,Grocery,So what ifI understand that I cant get my first choice and you cant get your first choice cause thats a deal barrier for me.,IDN
59,30,Grocery,So what if we get agreed on like 7:30 am to 7:30 pm.,OS
59,31,Wine,well still the 7:30 we will be closing the wine shop too early for me.,IP
59,32,Grocery,7:30s too early for you?,QS
59,33,Wine,"Yes and the most,the traffic that I get from the, from my experience is between like, after dinner and between late night. So where I get the most of profits out of it.",SBR
59,34,Wine,"And the bottle,the margins I have for the each model cause I sell like high end products, like high quality wine. That will bring more profits.",SBR
59,35,Wine,So I think to run the store together and bringing the wine customers and at the same time purchasing like high product organic groceries from your store then it would cause more profits than we expect so..,SBR
59,36,Grocery,"well lets look,lets look at what would bring a person, people into the store. Well whats going to bring the individual into, into the store? Theyre going to come to our store probably because they want food and wine right? They want the raw materials to make dinner and they also want some wine to go along with dinner.",SBR
59,37,Grocery,That means that were not really going to have that much of traffic after dinner hours. In fact the majority of the traffic is going to be before the dinner hours right?,SBR
59,38,Grocery,,
59,39,Wine,well but thebased on my the,SBR
59,40,Grocery,"Well you,your experience that, I dont know if you have any other stores attached to groceries stores right?",SBR
59,41,Grocery,Kinda demographics were shooting at right now. You know?,SBR
59,42,Grocery," All my other groceries dont have wine stores attached to them. So Im kind of,Im anticipating theyre going to be a whole bunch of new differences that we come across. Come across.",SBR
59,43,Grocery,Wine,And how about 10:30 and 10:30?,OS
59,44,Grocery,well see that kindathat kills our entire breakfast...thats where I get most of my profits.,SBR
59,45,Wine,hmm,MIN
59,46,Grocery,why dont we come back to that one?,PM
59,47,Wine,Ok.,MIN
59,48,Wine,"Next one was the,renovation costs.",P1
59,49,Grocery,Alright,MIN
59,50,Wine,"In theDupont Circle actually theres one lane,the store that has all wine and grocery stores on it.",SBR
59,51,Wine,"And since were already jumping in to where the competition is and we want to differentiate ourselves and differentiate position differently and unique for the what,this retail store can bring to the people and market in Dupont Circle.",SBR
59,52,Wine,"So,I guess, I believe renovating and design interior dcor would cost us at least 40 thousand dollars.",IP
59,53,Wine," To get all the interior done and,we have to fix the aisle where the people are moving.",SBR
59,54,Wine,We have to get all the lights and the Since were combining two different stores we have to come up with the same brand identity to provide people with identical,SBR
59,55,Grocery,"you want to,you want to provide them kinda like with a theme.",MIN
59,56,Wine,Well of course,SBR
59,57,Grocery,"and with,with a really neat interior.",SBR
59,58,Grocery,A really well designed place.,SBR
59,59,Wine,"not justjust...just throwing money off to just expensive interior but we have to have the concept and that,comingcoming with the concept itself costs money too.",SBR
59,60,Wine,,
59,61,Grocery,"well thats40 thousands light years away,from what I can afford.",SBR
59,62,Grocery,I cannot afford to spend more than 20.,IB
59,63,Grocery,So like 21 thousand is off the table.,IP
59,64,Grocery,And actually I would really really prefer to do it for a lot less.,IP
59,65,Grocery,But I can be a little it flexible about it.,PC
59,66,Grocery,They have all these setups so that were diametrically opposed.,OT
59,67,Grocery,Alright were going to have to split the decision on some of these.,PC
59,68,Grocery,"Cause 40,40 thousand dollars is off the charts for me.",IP
59,69,Way off the chart,,I dont have the kinda cash to spend like that.,SBR
59,70,Way off the chart,What I can settle for is 20. And thats it.,IB
59,71,Way off the chart,Wine,"how about theits doesnt have the options here solike How about spending like 40 thousand in the renovation and then we split up the,the first, the profits until we get into break even points.",CS
59,72,Grocery,"Kinda off the side,off the topic for a second. Theyve.. Ive got a chart here that says the options that I can suggest to you. And it says that we cant like, It says that I dont think that were allowed to...it says here please note that you must choose among your options",OT
59,73,Grocery,so I dont know if were allowed to beIn reality wed be creative right? But I dont think were going to be creative. I dont think they want us to be creative here.,OT
59,74,Grocery,Pleaseyea please limit yourself to these options for the purpose of this negotiation.,OT
59,75,Grocery,You dont have the same choices?,OT
59,76,Grocery,Wine,yes I do,OT
59,77,Grocery,oh you do?,OT
59,78,Grocery,Ok.,OT
59,79,Wine,"Sothen would,so 40 thousand is way off your budget?",QP
59,80,Grocery,"yea thatsyea thats,thats twice my maximum budget.",IP
59,81,Wine,so why dont we come in to the middle and settle on 30 thousand?,OS
59,82,Grocery,20 thousand is my absolute ceiling,IB
59,83,Wine,a thousand more and uhso we..,SBR
59,84,Grocery,20k is the absolute ceiling.,IB
59,85,Grocery,Thats the best I can do. I mean not like not non negotiating.i cant do it more than that.,Mineg
59,86,Grocery,,
59,87,Wine,"How about like,you spend 30 thousand and  Ill get you 10 thousand back from the first profit that we make",CS
59,88,Grocery,so in essence Id be spending 20k?,QM
59,89,Wine,"but for the initial,interior design we need to spend the money on the 30 thousand for now so eventually well get the",CS
59,90,Grocery,"Ill tell you what,Ill tell you what",MIN
59,91,Wine,extra budget reimbursed.,CS
59,92,Grocery,Tell you what; Ill give you 30 thousand if our store hours can be 7:30 to 7:30.,OM
59,93,Wine,uh 7:30 to 7:30 is too tight for me.,RN
59,94,Wine," And this will hurt my entire business and... I know,I can understand thethe nature of what the grocery store is in and you arethe products and the...what you",SBR
59,95,Grocery,its our breakfast that Im concerned about.,SBR
59,96,Wine,breakfast.,MIN
59,97,Wine,But Im thinking of like not just sort of breakfast but having a brunch menu and we can tap into a new market and bring more customers in the early hours.,CS
59,98,Wine,We can start from like 10:30 for example.,IP
59,99,Wine,Then we can throw more breakfast or the brunch people.,SBR
59,100,Wine,And then we can have the store open late night to get the more traffic going on and more profit going on in the store..,SBR
59,101,Grocery,So your suggesting 10:30 to 10:30?,QM
59,102,Wine,uh huh,MIN
59,103,Grocery,well see I would kinda disagree with that,RN
59,104,Grocery,"because if..10..if our wine sales are selling at 10:30...I mean even out in like Dupont,10:30 is kinda like a void.",SBR
59,105,Grocery,Thats between the time when people are finishing up the diner and going out. Theres not a lot of sales going on there.,SBR
59,106,Grocery," Then after 8 o clock,But I I would, I would agree in concept to staying open till like 2 in the morning.",SBR

62,0,Group 62
62,1,Name of Coder: Pooja
62,2,Date: 5/20/06
62,3,Grocery,Hi my name is Paul.,MIC
62,4,Wine,Hi Im Andrew.,MIC
62,5,Wine,How are you?,MIC
62,6,Grocery,Im good how are you?,MIC
62,7,Wine,Good.,MIC
62,8,Wine,And youre going to be running the grocery store?,MIC
62,9,Grocery,"Yeah,the grocery store.",MIC
62,10,Grocery,Youre wine?,MIC
62,11,Wine,Mmhmm.,MIC
62,12,Grocery,Ok I think this situation will be a little bit hard likebecauseokay.,MIC
62,13,Wine,Where are you from?,MIC
62,14,Grocery,I am from Korea.,MIC
62,15,Grocery,"Where,youre from here?",MIC
62,16,Wine,Yeah.,MIC
62,17,Grocery,How do you start?,PO
62,18,Wine,"Well,I think we have the same 5 issues in mind so how do you, how do you feel.",PO
62,19,Wine,Which issue is the most salient issue for you?,IR
62,20,Grocery,"I think,of course I think this is, I mean a very difficult situation because like we have like hours of operation.",P1
62,21,Grocery,"Maybe youre a wine shop maybe right so like you want to you want to open the store to late night because people go to your store at night usually,not in the morning right.",INP
62,22,Grocery,But I have to sell the breakfast and coffee for the people who come visit the company.,SBR
62,23,Grocery,"So for me the earlier,the earlier the better.",IP
62,24,Grocery,"So our renovation cost is around,usually wine store you need to look fancy, luxury.",INN
62,25,Grocery,The grocery store I think I dont have to spend too much money for renovation cost and floor space too,IP
62,26,Grocery,and temperature maybe we have different idea about that and opening date.,IDN
62,27,Grocery,I just want to go over each by each and I want to listen to your suggestion and Ill give my suggestion.,PO
62,28,Wine,"Okay,alright, we can do that.",MIC
62,29,Grocery,So what do you think about hours of operation?,QP
62,30,Wine,Well youre right I would like to open a little bit later.,IP
62,31,Wine,A wine shop wont do very well if it opens at 6:30 in the morning and closes at 6:30 at night.,SBR
62,32,Wine,Butso preferably the later the better for me,IP
62,33,Wine,but I understand that you need to be able to sell breakfast and a wine shop in D.C. isnt the same as some other stores that are just selling beer for late night drinkers.,INP
62,34,Wine,So usually people are coming into my store are drinking the wine with a meal that they have already planned out so they arent doing the last minute late night run thing.,MIC
62,35,Wine,So can you open at 9:30 is that too late in the morning?,OS
62,36,Grocery,9:30 is too late,RN
62,37,Grocery,Because people come into company early.,SBR
62,38,Grocery,I think its 9 oclock right?,QM
62,39,Grocery,Wine,But if you open at 8:30 so they could get to work at 9?,OS
62,40,Grocery,"Yeah I think so,may suggestion isYeah I totally understand your situation.",MIC
62,41,Grocery,"So I mean 6:30 is a little early for me too,I mean for the breakfast people.",MIC
62,42,Grocery,"Anyway,I prefer 7:30 /but maybe at 7:30 your store I mean if you, if the shop open, close at 7:30 you might have some problems.",IP/INP
62,43,Grocery,"S0 I think my suggestion 8:30 because 8:30 people come into the,I mean usually people come into their company usually by 9 oclock and after 8:30 you have some, I mean,  you can serve some wine.",OS
62,44,Grocery,Maybe you can .by 9 oclock.,MIN
62,45,Grocery,I think it is going to be fine.,MIC
62,46,Wine,"Okay,alright, that works.",RP
62,47,Grocery,How about renovation cost?,QP
62,48,Wine,Well I honestly think that any money we are going to sink into renovating is going to come back to us in the long run. So I think renovation costs will pay for themselves eventually.,SBR
62,49,Wine,,And I know that you were are feeling that a grocery store doesnt need to look fancy but I dont know that that is necessarily true.,SBR
62,50,Wine,I mean there are grocery stores that spend more money on how they look and on appearances and are able to charge more for it.,SBR
62,51,Wine,So maybe you could actually make back some of the money we sink into renovation costs by charging a little bit more.,SBR
62,52,Wine,You are already connected to a wine shop thats kind of a higher-end feel about the store anyway.,SBR
62,53,Grocery,"I personally agree with that that,agree that we need renovation but my focus on renovation is I mean, not the fancy.",SBR
62,54,Grocery,I mean my concept of renovation is clean not fancy.,SBR
62,55,Grocery,"So I mean,if I make my grocery store fancy maybe people think its trick or and its very easy to get dirty. I think, thats why I think I need renovation but I dont know, my store doesnt need renovation that fancy and my focus is clean so",SBR
62,56,Wine,Well clean is something that we are going to have to maintain anyway right?,SBR
62,57,Wine,"I mean no matter how it starts off its going to get dirty so well have to keep it clean anyway,but fancy might might bring in people that will spend more money in your grocery store.",SBR
62,58,Wine,It might allow you to charge more money.,SBR
62,59,Wine,"Maybe you couldif it looked fancy,they might expect some more unusual products that might allow you to sell some things that you dont find in other grocery stores in Dupont Circle.",SBR
62,60,Grocery,So how much money do you suggest?,QP
62,61,Wine,"I would like to spend $25,000.",IP
62,62,Grocery,"25,000,okay.",MIN
62,63,Wine,"I mean ideally,I would love to spend 30, but I know that you probably cant spend that much.",IP
62,64,Grocery,"Okay,thats good then.",RP
62,65,Wine,Does 25 work?,QM
62,66,Wine,Okay.,MIC
62,67,Grocery,How about floor space?,QP
62,68,Wine,"Well I feel like you are going to need more of the space than I will,right?",IDN
62,69,Grocery,I think so.,IP
62,70,Wine,You have more products than I do.,IDN
62,71,Grocery,Yeah I have more products maybe.,SBR
62,72,Grocery,"I need I mean I need more employee and little more space,so",SBR
62,73,Wine,But we still are going to be splitting the cost for utilities right down the middle.,SBR
62,74,Grocery,I mean in that case I can pay more.,SBR
62,75,Wine,I mean that isnt one of our issues but,MIN
62,76,Wine,Well how much space would you like?,QP
62,77,Grocery,"I think,as I told you I spend I need little bit more space, maybe 60 percent.",IP
62,78,Wine,So you want to do it 60/40?,QM
62,79,Grocery,"Yeah,60/40 for space.",OS
62,80,Grocery,Is that a problem?,QM
62,81,Wine,"Yeah,yeah I think thats ok.",RP
62,82,Wine," Thats ok because I mean,you have a lot more products than I do.",MIC
62,83,Grocery,"Thats right,thats right.",MIN
62,84,Wine,"And that is close to what were spending for the utilities so okay,I think 60/40 we can wok with that.",MIC
62,85,Grocery,Ok thats fine.,MIC
62,86,Grocery,What about temperature?,P1
62,87,Wine,What is your preference for temperature?,QP
62,88,Wine,I know a lot of grocery stores need to be kept cool.,SBR
62,89,Grocery,Yeah I have my temperature at uhh,MIN
62,90,Wine,You have refrigerated products right?,QS
62,91,Grocery,Thats true.,MIN
62,92,Grocery,Ahh you have a wine so you are serving only wine not beer.,SBR
62,93,Wine,"Right,in D.C. you can only sell wine or beer. So I am a wine shop.",SF
62,94,Grocery,Oh really?,QM
62,95,Grocery,So what is your suggestion?,QP
62,96,Wine,Well even wine it doesnt need to be refrigerated like beer does but it still keeps better in a cooler environment.,IP
62,97,Wine," Do your groceries need to be kept cool,or does it not matter for them as much?",QS
62,98,Grocery,"Well because we are selling a vegetable,some kind of fruit so maybe...I think it needs to be a little bit cold. I mean not cold I mean cool.",IP
62,99,Grocery,Wine,65 degrees is that too cold for you?,QP
62,100,Grocery,"65 is a little bit cold,I guess.",IP
62,101,Wine,Thats too cold for you?,QP
62,102,Grocery,Yes 65 is a little bit cold.,IP
62,103,Grocery,What about 69?,OS
62,104,Grocery,Its a big difference?,QP
62,105,Wine,That might be a little bit warm for my wines.,IP
62,106,Wine,"The thing is,because wine needs to be kept in a cool area to keep for a long time and if its too far, if its too warm it wont keep as well.",SBR
62,107,Grocery,"Some of my products shouldnt be like over,over 80 degrees",IP
62,108,Wine,"Oh,really?",QM
62,109,Grocery,"Yeah but I have to buy other acumens to this one and if temperature is too cold,I have to spend,  I have to pay more energy cost, I mean energy price.",SBR
62,110,Grocery,I understand your problem like your wine needs to be cold.,INP
62,111,Grocery,But I dont think 69 and 65 is not that different.,SBR
62,112,Wine,Okay.,MIN
62,113,Grocery,And after that I meanwe can say 69 works and after that if you have some problem we can change.,OS
62,114,Grocery,"If you say 65 is fine,I mean  I dont think 65 and 69 is that different.",SBR
62,115,Wine,"Okay,alright we can go with 69 then.",RP
62,116,Grocery,What about open date?,P1
62,117,Grocery,You want to open as soon as possible right?,QP
62,118,Wine,Luckily I have most of my products already so for me its just a matter of getting ready to sell it / and if we can get the renovations done by May it would be nice.,SBR/ IP
62,119,Wine," I am sure that you are eager to get into business too,right?",QP
62,120,Grocery,"Yeah,but I have some, I need some time",IP
62,121,Grocery,"because some of my product like some of my primary product I have to import from other countries,",SBR
62,122,Grocery,and usually I have to higher some people to work for me.,SBR
62,123,Grocery,So I need some time. I dont want to open the store that late.,IP
62,124,Grocery,"How aboutI think Junehow about July 1st,its really late?",OS
62,125,Wine,Well just because summer is a big wine selling season.,SBR
62,126,Wine,"People like being outside with their friends and they go to the beach and they sit on their roofs,especially Dupont Circle. You know how everyone sits outside on the sidewalks.",SBR
62,127,Wine,So for me the earlier the better to sell my product.,IP
62,128,Wine,"Is June too early for you,does that not allow you enough time?",QP
62,129,Grocery,Yeah I think I need to hurry for opening,MIN
62,130,Grocery,but I think I can hire and train people for opening for a month in that case,SBR
62,131,Grocery,but probably I have to get some special items from other country.,SBR
62,132,Grocery,I mean it might take some time.,SBR
62,133,Wine,Now are you able to sell other things in the meantime while you are waiting for some of those special items?,QS
62,134,Grocery,Yeah I mean if I order special items out of the country so it might..usually the process is a little bit.,SBR
62,135,Wine,"No,I understand I have to import things too so I know how it is.",MIC
62,136,Grocery,Ok thats good June 1st.,OS
62,137,Wine,Is June 1st ok?,QM
62,138,Grocery,Yeah its fine.,RP
62,139,Wine,"Alright,so that seems that it works for both of us.",RP
62,140,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN
63,0,Grocery,Hi,MI-C
63,1,Wine,Im Megan.,MI-C
63,2,Wine,Nice to meet you.,MI-C
63,3,Grocery,Nice to meet you too.,MI-C
63,4,Wine,Do you just want to go through each issue?,PO            
63,5,Grocery,I think we can start on our,PO              
63,6,Grocery,Lets prioritize one and we can probably come up with the others.,PO
63,7,Wine,That sounds good.,MI-C
63,8,Grocery,"First of all the grand opening date,it looks like I have no choice.",
63,9,SB-R
63,10,SB-R
63,11,,September 1st would be best for me.,IP
63,12,Wine,Is there a reason we have to wait so long for it?,QS    
63,13,Grocery,Because there are just more employees involved with the grocery store.,SB-R
63,14,Grocery,And if I dont have the employees ready and everything ready people come in they have a bad first impression of the store.,SB-R
63,15,Grocery,Probably less people will come in the future.,SB-R
63,16,Grocery,I think the first impression is very important.,SB-R
63,17,Wine,Yeah I agree.,MI-C
63,18,Wine,"I just think that earlier the start,we can start making a profit too.",SB-R
63,19,Grocery,"Yeah,so what is your date?",QP
63,20,Wine,For me May would be the best. The earlier the better.,IP
63,21,Wine,Grocery,but I see.,MI-N
63,22,Wine,I think as long as the renovations are done,SB-R
63,23,Wine,You dont think you can get employees before September?,QS
63,24,Grocery,It will be hard.,MI-NEG
63,25,Grocery," I mean,cause with the later date you can also have more advertising done on the radio",SB-R
63,26,Grocery,and its better because people will stop by and notice this new store more often.,SB-R
63,27,Grocery,So if youI can be more lenient on the other parts if you want to help me out on this one.,PX         
63,28,Wine,Well do you want to discuss the other ones too and then you can kind of like decide.,PO
63,29,Grocery,Yeah,MI-N
63,30,Wine,Ok well what about the temperature?,QP
63,31,Wine,I mean the cooler the better/ because it preserves the wine better.,IP/SB-R
63,32,Wine,So 65 degrees would be ideal.,IP
63,33,Wine,But I probably couldnt go much more than 67/ because the stuff would go bad.,IB
63,34,Grocery,I totally agree with you and,MI-C
63,35,How about if we go up a little bit for 69?,OS
63,36,How about if we go up a little bit for 69?,See like it would be very hard for me to take a low degree.,SB-R
63,37,How about if we go up a little bit for 69?,So we can meet in the middle point if you agree.,PC
63,38,Wine,Umm.,MI-N
63,39,Wine,69 just seems a lot warmer than 65.,SB-R
63,40,Wine,I think like that if wine is not as good a quality it is bad for both of our businesses you know? I mean,SB-R
63,41,Grocery,Oh definitely/ but red wines you dont need to keep them in the fridge.,MI-C/SB-R
63,42,Grocery,"And the liquors and vodka theyre fine,theyre totally fine.",SB-R
63,43,Grocery,You probably just need a very little fridge for beers and ice and your white wines you can keep them in the fridge,SB-R
63,44,Grocery,that will be more like inviting to the customers because they will be touching a cold white wine and for me it is a urge to drink it so,SB-R
63,45,Wine,I think just it is important to keep the product though.,SB-R     
63,46,Wine,I think it is easier for a person to bring a coat into a grocery store or like a jacket and keep a little bit warmer if they are shopping and they get cold.,SB-R
63,47,Wine,And like if the products are good thats whats more important to the people who are shopping.,SB-R
63,48,Grocery,"Okay,I see.",MI-N
63,49,Wine,I can do 67,IP
63,50,Wine,but I feel like 69 is going to be kind of a little too warm and risky to the product.,SB-R
63,51,Wine,Lets talk about all of them I guess and then well decide.,PO           
63,52,Wine,How about floor space?,QP
63,53,Grocery,Floor space?,QM
63,54,Grocery,I guess Id go for 50.,IP
63,55,Wine,Id ideally like a little bit less like 40% would be better,IP
63,56,Wine,"just because wine doesnt take as much food,as much space up as food.",SB-R
63,57,Wine,I mean ideally you would want 50 percent., IN-P 
63,58,Grocery,40 percent for you.,MI-N
63,59,Wine,And 60 for you.,MI-N
63,60,Grocery,Because floor is very expensive considering like monthly payment and also during like snow days.,SB-R
63,61,Grocery,How much you pay for cleaning up the parking lot is also determined by your space.,SB-R
63,62,Grocery,"So for me to take a lot of space it would be like a you know,continuous expenditure.",SB-R
63,63,Wine,Right definitely but you would also probably have a higher profit just because food typically brings in more than,SB-R
63,64,Grocery,Well I can always maximize my storage by more shelves and everything.,SB-R
63,65,Wine,But I wouldnt even have enough product to really take up 50 percent of the space.,SB-R
63,66,Grocery,Yeah.,MI-N
63,67,Wine,So it would be like I am paying for more space that I am not really using.,SB-R
63,68,Wine,You could use the space and you would be making money off the space you are using whereas I really wouldnt be making any more or less.,SB-R
63,69,Grocery,Yeah I am just afraid that the extra space wont cover my continuous cost monthly and for every winter and summer.,SB-R
63,70,Wine,I feel like when I am grocery shopping though when things are laid out properly it is easier to like shop and get the things that you want than it is if stuff is piled all the way up and you cant really reach it.,SB-R
63,71,Wine,And it becomes hard for people like have little kids ore someone in a wheelchair.,SB-R
63,72,Wine,And just for like a grocery store there is so much more product than there is for.,SB-R
63,73,Grocery,Well if you can help me out in temperature or grand opening date I might be able to take up more floor space.,PP
63,74,Grocery,If I can if I can just lower my cost in temperature keeping the temperature I might be able to recover the local cost for paying the extra rent that Ill be paying for.,SB-R
63,75,Grocery,Do you see what Im saying?,QM
63,76,Wine,I do see what youre saying.,MI-C
63,77,Wine,Lets discuss the rest of them briefly too and try to see where we are on them.,PO
63,78,Wine,Umm for renovation/ I was thinking the more money we put into it the more money we will probably get out of it.,P1/ SB-R
63,79,Wine,So I was thinking the more money we put into it the more well probably get out of it.,SB-R
63,80,Wine,"So I would say 30,000 dollars to get our moneys worth for it.",IP
63,81,Grocery,Okay.,MI-N
63,82,Wine,I think you have to spend money to make money you know.,SB-R
63,83,Wine,The nicer it looks people are going to feel like they are shopping in a better place and they are going to justify spending a good amount of money.,SB-R
63,84,Grocery,Do you want to do it in the interior or exterior?,QM
63,85,Wine,I think both.,MI-N
63,86,Grocery,Like what would be your emphasis on?,QM
63,87,Wine,Exterior and interior.,MI-N
63,88,Wine,I think both of them needs work.,SB-R
63,89,Wine,Just the image of the store. (Include in above),
63,90,Wine,I think especially when youre buying wine and upscale products.,SB-R
63,91,Grocery,Yeah you probably want fancy furniture and stuff whereas for me it is just shelves and shelves and shelves and shelves and counters/ so wow.,ID-P/ MI-NEG
63,92,Grocery,"$30,000 dollars,thats a lot.",RN
63,93,Wine,Well what would you be looking to spend?,QP
63,94,Grocery,Much less.,IP
63,95,Grocery,"I would be go for 10,000/ because for me shelves are not really costly.",IP/SB-R
63,96,Grocery,"And the outside is really nice too,so.",SB-R
63,97,Grocery,And hours of operation?,QP
63,98,Grocery,I understand you probably want to open up as late as you can because people dont wake up early in the morning too.,IN-P
63,99,Wine,Go alcohol shopping right.,SB-R
63,100,Grocery,But I would need to start baking my pastries and bakeries and get things ready for people.,SB-R
63,101,Wine,So you would look at 6:30?,QP
63,102,Grocery,Definitely.,RP
63,103,Grocery,But umm.,MI-N
63,104,Wine,"Well,I guess which is the most important to you as far as getting it as close to your ideal as possible?",QR
63,105,Wine,Grocery,"I really really want to minimize my cost in floor space,/ due to the environment like the climate control thing.",IR/ SB-R
63,106,Wine,"And I really really want to get ready for my grand opening,",IR
63,107,Wine,"because I dont want people to come in with things not done,because many of my product will take longer to ship for me.",SB-R
63,108,Wine,So if you can help me in grand opening date I might sacrifice a little in others.,PX
63,109,Wine,I can delay my hours of operation a little bit.,PC
63,110,Wine,For hours of operation,MI-N
63,111,Wine,For grand opening/ do you think you could do August 1st/ so that its only a month earlier than you would want to.,P1/  OS/ SB-R
63,112,Grocery,August 1st?,QM
63,113,Wine,For grand opening date?,MI-N
63,114,Grocery,I might be able to.,RP
63,115,Grocery,Yeah lets take that down for now. (include with above),PO
63,116,Grocery,"What if I take up more floor space,can you cope with a temperature thats higher than yours?",PP
63,117,Wine,If you take 50 percent you mean?,QM
63,118,Grocery,I mean you want 40 percent,MI-N
63,119,I want 40 percent I mean yeah Im sorry if you take 60,MI-N
63,120,So if I satisfy you on that aspect,MI-N
63,121,Wine,What would the temperature be?,QP
63,122,Grocery,Is there any chance that you can take 73?,OS
63,123,Wine,"The product would go bad,the product would go bad.",SB-R
63,124,Grocery,What if you do 71?,OS
63,125,Wine,I think 69 is the lowest.,IB
63,126,Grocery,Because you can add the fridge and the electricity cost.,SB-R
63,127,Grocery,Half of it would be mine.,SB-R
63,128,Grocery,I would be covering your cost in electricity even if you are keeping a fridge and it would look good for your customer.,SB-R
63,129,Grocery,The cost will back to me.,SB-R
63,130,Wine,Id really rather do 69,IP
63,131,Wine,because I think those 2 degrees could make a big difference but lets hold off on that one.,SB-R
63,132,Wine,ForWhat about renovation costs?,QP
63,133,Grocery,Renovation cost?,QM
63,134,Grocery," If I sacrifice my hours of operation,can you settle for a lower renovation cost?",PP
63,135,Grocery,What would be your limit?,QB
63,136,Wine,I would like to spend as much as possible /just so that it would be important to business.,IP/SB-R
63,137,Wine," So 30,000 is what I would be willing to spend for it.",IP
63,138,Wine,But maybe if you would be willing to spend more on renovation I would be willing to take 50 percent of the floor space/ so you would save on your rent cost then too.,OM/SB-R
63,139,Wine," Cause didnt you say you wanted less,50 percent of the floor space to be able to for the rent.",SB-R
63,140,Grocery,Oh I thought we already settled that with the grand opening.,MI-N
63,141,Grocery,Oh I see what youre saying/ that would be great.,MI-C/ RP
63,142,Grocery,But for hours of operation is really important to me too.,IR
63,143,Grocery,Because if I dont get the food ready people probably will not come since people like want to start shopping now.,SB-R
63,144,Wine,I would be willing to compromise in hours of operation because I think,PC
63,145,Grocery,Would you settle for 8:30?,OS
63,146,Wine,That sounds good to me.,RP
63,147,Grocery,So if we settle at 8:30,MI-N
63,148,Wine,Thats right in the middle for both of us right?,QM
63,149,Grocery,Yeah.,MI-N
63,150,Wine,Cause you wanted to open at 6:30 so thats fair.,RT
63,151,Grocery,If I open 2 hours late can you minimize your renovation cost?,PP
63,152,Wine,"Well Im opening 2 hoursI know your opening 2 hours later but I am opening 2 hours earlier than I want to,too.",SB-R
63,153,Wine,So it is right in the middle for that so I think we are both kind of giving up the same thing.,SB-R
63,154,Wine,But I think if we spend more on renovation that would help my business so I could probably afford more rent and take 50 percent of the floor space.,SB-R
63,155,Wine,So you would want 50 percent of the floor space.,MI-N
63,156,Grocery,Yes/ but that renovation cost is very very high.,SBR
63,157,Grocery,I probably cant afford it right away because I am just a little grocery store.,SB-R
63,158,Wine,"What about 25,000 and then I would take 50 percent of the floor space.",OM
63,159,Wine,Which would end up saving you,SB-R
63,160,Grocery,How about I cover all of your renovation.,PP
63,161,Grocery,I mean I agree with you on your renovation cost and you let me open early. (Include with above),PP
63,162,Grocery,Cause that is important to me.,IR
63,163,Grocery,I am being very strict because I have to cook everything because otherwise I have nothing to sell./ So product is very important to me.,SB-R/ IR
63,164,Grocery," If I give you 30,000 for renovation,can you give me my hours of operation?",PP
63,165,Wine,"Could we open at 7:30 and we could do $25,000 in renovation costs.",OM
63,166,Wine,I dont know many people that go grocery shopping before 7:30.,SB-R
63,167,Wine,And that way when they first come in at 7:30 or 8 their bread could be fresh.,SB-R
63,168,Grocery,People go shopping at 7:30 probably but then I cannot start cooking at 7:30.,SB-R
63,169,Grocery,At least we should agree on what we did before.,PO
63,170,Grocery,Grand opening August 1st is ok for you?,QP
63,171,Grocery,So Ill take the 60 floor but youre going to give me the temperature right?,OM
63,172,Wine,I really cant do the 71.,RN
63,173,Wine,I think it is going to make my product go too bad.,SB-R
63,174,Wine,If you can do 69 degrees then Ill take,MI- N
63,175,Grocery,I already delayed my grand opening date so,SB-R
63,176,Grocery,And Im taking extra floor space and,SB-R
63,177,Wine,I can take 50 percent of the floor space if you can do 69 degrees,OM
63,178,Wine,because that is really important to me to get a good product.,SB-R
63,179,Grocery,Then I have to start in September,OM
63,180,Grocery,because if I am taking 69 degrees then that will like an on-going cost for me.,SB-R
63,181,Grocery,You see Im sacrificing a lot there.,SB-R
63,182,Grocery,You see I need September 1st otherwise it will be hard for me.,SB-E
63,183,Wine,I just dont see how temperature is going to effect your cost for If we,SB-R
63,184,Grocery,"So if you give me September 1st,I can do 69 degrees for you and I can take 60% of the floor space, I can give you a renovation cost of 25,000.",OM
63,185,Grocery,"Thats like the next step to your best,/ and then I can do 8:30",SB-R/OM
63,186,Grocery,or 7:30. (Include with above),OM
63,187,Wine,"Okay,yeah lets do that.",RP
63,188,Wine,"So were going to do September 1st now,right?",QM
63,189,Grocery,"Okay,Ill give you 79 degree.",MI-N
63,190,Wine,"69,okay.",RP
63,191,Grocery,Yeah and Ill take up the floor space.,MI-N
63,192,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
63,193,Grocery,So since you take the floor space/ do you want to open at 7:30?,MI-C/ OS
63,194,Wine,Thank you so much.,RP
63,195,Grocery,"And then renovation at 30,000.",MI-N
63,196,Wine,"I said 25,000.",OS
63,197,Grocery,Okay done!,MI-C
63,198,Grocery,"Yay,I can go home now.",MI-C
63,199,Wine,Alright!,MI-C
63,200,Grocery,So youve been here less than 4 years?,OT
63,201,Wine,Im a junior yeah.,OT
63,202,Grocery,No I mean in this country.,OT
63,203,Wine,Oh yeah.,OT
63,204,Grocery,Where you from?,OT
63,205,Wine,Germany.,OT
64,0,Grocery,Hi.,MI-C
64,1,Wine,Hi.,MI-C
64,2,Grocery,My name is Cassie and Im from the grocery store that will be combining with your winery.,MI-C
64,3,Grocery,,
64,4,Wine,Yes Im Stacey and it appears that the winery is the ye ole wine shop.,MI-C
64,5,Wine,Grocery,"Alright and we all agree that we have a couple of points to discuss,right before we come to a conclusion?",PO
64,6,Wine,Yes.,MI-C
64,7,Grocery,"So what I want to focus on is well I guess we should all talk about its hours of operation and then renovation cost,I think is one of the main points and then floor space we all want it looking nice and everything and then temperature and grand opening date.",PO
64,8,Grocery,Wine,The no reason not to start at the beginning with the hours of operation.,P1
64,9,Grocery,What are you thinking in terms of hours of operation?,QP
64,10,Grocery,"Well considering that I have a coffee shop that will open early,",SB-R
64,11,Grocery,So itd be best for me to open as early as I can.,IP
64,12,Grocery,But I also take into consideration that you opened a winery and most people dont go in the morning.,IN-P
64,13,Wine,Yes.,MI-N
64,14,Grocery,And given the options that we have I would say we could come to asort of at a middle point.,PC
64,15,Wine,I think that is totally reasonable yes.,MIC
64,16,Grocery,So I think 8:30 for me is too late.,RN
64,17,Grocery,So I was thinking 7:30 am to 7:30 pm.,IP
64,18,Grocery,Considering that most people dont go out anymore after 7:30. If they were going to plan to buy something they have bought it already.,SB-R
64,19,Grocery,,
64,20,Wine,Yes and I can definitely see your point about your coffee shop opening early.,MIC
64,21,Wine,So umm I would probably be willing to do 7:30 as long as some of the other items work out well so,PX
64,22,Grocery,Sure we could just put it down on there first.,PO
64,23,Grocery," Well,I think we should talk about temperature next.",P1
64,24,Grocery,Because temperature is not really a main problem for us,IR
64,25,Grocery,considering that most of the food in the grocery store will be fine like regular temperature.,SB-R
64,26,Grocery,I am sure wine is the same way.,SB-R
64,27,Wine,Yeah there isnt a huge variations in temperatures.,MI-N
64,28,Grocery,So do you want to say like the normal temperature which is like what other stores usually have like 73 degrees around there.,OS
64,29,Wine,"73 is too warm,the wine does not do optimally above 70 degrees.",SBR
64,30,Wine,Ideally it would be around 60 between 65 and 69 would be optimal.,IP
64,31,Wine,"Obviously,nobody wants customers to be freezing.",SB-R
64,32,Grocery,Right so,MI-N
64,33,Wine,So 69 might be a little cool but 69 would certainly be fine.,IP
64,34,Grocery,I think 69 is a little cold for some of my products,RN
64,35,Grocery,"like I would say vegetables and fruits they might get frozen,maybe not frozen but damaged by the cold.",SB-R
64,36,Grocery,"I would agree to 71 if that is ok with you /since 1 or 2 degrees wouldnt make that much of a difference,right?",OS/SB-R
64,37,Wine,Yeah let me think lets put a little dot by that for now.,PO
64,38,Grocery,Alright so what do you want to talk about next?,P1
64,39,Wine,The floor space.,P1
64,40,Grocery,What do you think?,QP
64,41,Wine,Ahh definitely no more than 50 percent.,IP
64,42,Wine,Do not need more than that other wise it is going to be a waste of space.,SB-R
64,43,Wine,There is just not enough wine for to cover more than 50 percent.,SB-R
64,44,Wine,Anything less than that would certainly is certainly fine.,IP
64,45,Grocery,Ok well since consider that you want the temper well we were talking about the temperature earlier right?,PO
64,46,Wine,Yes.,MI-N
64,47,Grocery,So you said you want the 69 degrees would be more likely?,QP
64,48,Wine,Um hum.,MI-N
64,49,Grocery,OK lets see if I give youUmm let me think.,OM
64,50,Grocery,Ok if I take 60 percent of the space and Ill give you the 69 degrees would that work for you?,OM
64,51,Wine,Ok so 60 percent of the space for you and 69 degrees?,QM
64,52,Grocery,Right,MIN
64,53,Wine,Yes.,RP
64,54,Wine,So Id get 40% of the floor space mathematically speaking and 69 degrees.,MIN
64,55,Grocery,Ok the next one will be the 2 most important one. One is for cost and the other one is grand opening date.,IR
64,56,Grocery,Wine,Yes,MI-N
64,57,Grocery,So umm I think we should talk about grand opening date first.,P1
64,58,Grocery,What do you think?,QP
64,59,Wine,As far as the wine is concerned the earlier the better,IP
64,60,Wine,because there is no real preparation for that. We basically just have to get the wine in and put them out.,SB-R
64,61,Wine,But I understand that you have more variable products.,IN-P
64,62,Wine,Timing is a little bit more of an issue for you.,IN-P
64,63,Wine,So my feeling is the earlier the better no earlier than May 1st but absolutely willing to go in the May June July area absolutely.,IP
64,64,Wine,Grocery,Well I was thinking since I have to order stuff from oversea and that might take a little bit of time.,SB-R
64,65,Wine,If we could do umm lets say September that would be best for me,IP
64,66,Wine,because I really want a time to plan out things and get my employees so we can all start and they are all prepared and nothing goes wrong.,SB-R
64,67,Wine,And that would be beneficial for both of us.,SB-R
64,68,Wine,Well unfortunately I cant do September that is just too late.,RN
64,69,Wine," Id prefer July I would be willing to consider August 1st obviously,but September is just too late.",IP
64,70,Wine,,,
64,71,Grocery,Ok well umm lets talk about renovate 1st.,P1
64,72,Grocery,"What is your maximum,What do you prefer to spend on your? ",QP
64,73,Wine,"Umm 20,000 would be reasonable as far as Im concerned. No less than 10,000.",IP
64,74,Wine,Grocery,Right understand that.,MI-C
64,75,Wine,Its got to look good.,SB-R
64,76,Wine,It is very important especially in the Dupont Circle area where everything is very nice. Youve got a lot of up scale competition.,SB-R
64,77,Wine,,So what are you thinking for renovation costs?,QP
64,78,Grocery,"I was actually thinking around 15 around there,but I guess were pretty close,",IP
64,79,Grocery,because I dont think well need that much decoration.,SB-R
64,80,Grocery,I think what is more important is how our service is are,SB-R
64,81,Grocery,and I believe that the day we open 1st would be the most important because the reason I chose September 1st is because that is the beginning of the whole school year and everything and I think people will be like buying more things,SB-R
64,82,Grocery,,because the weather is changing from like hot summer to like cold times.,SB-R
64,83,Grocery,I would think people would drink more wine like later after like July you know.,SB-R
64,84,Wine,Well that would give us more time so if we could spend more on the renovations I might be able to consider September 1st.,PP
64,85,Grocery,True.,MI-N
64,86,Wine,Because that would give them more time to install renovations because you dont want to rush through things.,SB-R
64,87,Grocery,Right,MI-N
64,88,Wine,"As far as renovations are concerned I would be willing to go up to 30,000 but I do not need to go that high.",IP
64,89,Wine,"Umm 20,000 would be great. And then we could push the opening to September 1st if that works for you.",OM
64,90,Wine,Grocery,"Ummm,lets see.",MI-N
64,91,Wine,"Yeah we could do that we could do 20,000.",RP
64,92,Wine,So then we would open our store at September 1st right?,QM
64,93,Wine,Right.,MIN
64,94,Grocery,So umm I think we should talk a little bit more about the temperature.,P1
64,95,Wine,Ok,MI-N
64,96,Grocery,Because it really worries me that if it is too low it would be not that good for my products to stay fresh ok.,SB-R
64,97,Wine,We had said 69 degrees right?,QM
64,98,Grocery,Right,MI-N
64,99,Wine,I could do 71.,OS
64,100,Grocery,Ok sure!,RP
64,101,Wine,Not any higher than that but 71 should be ok,MIC
64,102,Grocery,"OK well so far we have open from 7:30-7:30 am-pm and then umm 20,000 renovation costs.",MI-N
64,103,Wine,Yes,MI-N
64,104,Grocery,And umm 60 percent for me 40 percent for you in floor spacing.,MI-N
64,105,Wine,Um hum,MI-N
64,106,Grocery,And 71 degrees which I think is pretty average shouldnt be any problem and then September 1st as our opening date.,MI-N
64,107,Grocery,So do you want to take a minute to think about it first before we decide?,PO
64,108,Wine,Yeah let me justOk I have no complaints let things as they stand now.,MI-C
64,109,Wine,How do you feel?,QM
64,110,Grocery,Yeah I think I am content with the agreement.,MI-C
64,111,Wine,I dont think anything is absolutely ideal but that means the compromiseswhich is reasonable.,MI-C
64,112,Wine,We are not doing anything extreme.,MI-C
64,113,Grocery,Alright!,MI-C
64,114,Wine,"Okay,I think were good then!",MI-C
65,0,Wine,Hi./,MIC

65,10,Wine,Grocery,Sure!/,MIC
65,11,Wine,Well I guess the first thing that concerned me was the hours of operation./ How much of an issue is that to you?/,P1/ QR
65,12,Wine,I think because we sell the wines and the liquors/ the later the better so./,SF/IP
65,13,Grocery,Yeah I figured you would probably say that./,INN
65,14,Grocery,"Of course,I am a bakery so I sell coffees things in the morning/I tend to serve morning customers./",SBR/IP
65,15,Wine,Also at late times people study for some stuff./,SBR
65,16,Grocery,"Thats true,thats true I do have some evening studiers which is very helpful./",MIC
65,17,Grocery," So I dont know,so give me a number, what sort of hours are you looking for?/",QP
65,18,Wine,I prefer some later time like till 10:30 am./,IP

65,20,Grocery,Thats a little bit late for me./,IP
65,21,Wine,Whats your number?/,QP
65,22,Grocery,Well I do want to try get things open a little bit later for you/,PC
65,23,Grocery,so maybe I could. I could go to 7:30./,OS
65,24,Wine,7:30?/,QM
65,25,Grocery,Yeah/,MIN
65,26,Wine,Oh I think at that time people still I mean not enough people will come to get wine. People still enjoy the parties at late time./,SBR
65,27,Wine,And also I think you dont just do bakery right. You do other stuff?/,SBR
65,28,Grocery,Yeah cappuccinos andits kind of like a coffee shop with some groceries that you can buy as well./,SBR
65,29,Wine,Yeah so its a grocery shop then people will need something late orso I think maybe you can just open a little bit later./,SBR
65,30,Grocery,Well how about is 8:30 ok?/,OS
65,31,Grocery,I mean boy I am really stretching it here./,SBR
65,32,Wine,"No,/ I mean 8:30 people will still I mean just after their dinner they havent started their party or drinking./",RN/ SBR
65,33,Grocery,You think so?/,QS
65,34,Wine,Yeah I think because people like to do some happy things at night./,SBR
65,35,Grocery,Ok well maybe we should come back to this./,PM
65,36,Grocery,There are some other things that I dont know are really important to me and this isnt quite as important. Actually the biggest issue for me its very important is opening date./,IR
65,37,Grocery,,I need to do it later it is really critical.,IP
65,38,Wine,Ok this is biggest issue for you/,MIC
65,39,Wine,I think the biggest issue for me is renovation cost./,IR
65,40,Wine,"I just think that if we want to do this at a very later time,/",SBR
65,41,Wine,"if we want to be famous or be really well,/",SBR
65,42,Wine,I think we should put a lot of money on the renovation.,IP
65,43,Grocery,Why?/,QM
65,44,Grocery,"Geez,I thought the shop was really nice. I mean you know it needs a little bit of work but I thought it was great./",SBR
65,45,Grocery,Wine,I think it just didnt give everything on the decoration there. Because it is kind of a whole change because it is from some other things to this grocery and wine./,SBR
65,46,Grocery,We should do some renovation let people know everything is here it is an easy shop you can stop by./,SBR
65,47,Grocery,And I think in the long run the money will be paid back. So I think if we pay more we will get more.,SBR
65,48,Grocery,Grocery,So how much are we talking?/,QP
65,49,Wine,"I want to spend 30,000./",IP
65,50,Grocery,Well you know that is more than I planned on/,SBR
65,51,Grocery,but I agree a really nice renovation could be fun./,MIC
65,52,Grocery,"But yeah I mean I think how about 25,000?/",OS
65,53,Grocery,I mean is that,MIN
65,54,Wine,"25,000?/",QM
65,55,Grocery,That would help save me just a bit more./,SBR
65,56,Wine,"Well if you can give me 30,000 then I can put the time to 8:30 I think./",OM
65,57,Grocery,To 8:30 you think so?/,QM
65,58,Wine,Okay./,MIN
65,59,Grocery,"Yeah lets do that so lets agree,8:30 am-pm and 30,000 renovations./",RP
65,60,Wine,Yes./,MIN
65,61,Grocery,Okay./,MIN
65,62,Wine,And then the other things will be no problem./,MIC
65,63,Grocery,But anyway the grand opening date is really important to me/,IR
65,64,Grocery,and I would really really like to push it back to September 1st./,IP
65,65,Grocery,Ive got some products Id love to order/,SBR
65,66,Grocery,and I need to train some new employees./,SBR

65,68,Grocery,Well I mean there are things that I have to order from foreign countries and they take a long time to get here./,SBR
65,69,Grocery,And then if we have a grand opening and I have employees who dont know what they are doing that looks pretty bad./,SBR
65,70,Wine,Yeah thats true./,MIC
65,71,Wine,I can consider but September is still too late./,IP
65,72,Wine,Can we do like Jul 1st or?/,OS

65,79,Wine,So you have some?/,QS
65,80,Grocery,Yes I do./,SBR

65,83,Grocery,Its going to be a real financial burden?/,QP
65,84,Wine,Uh huh./,MIN

65,86,Grocery,Im going to sustain./,MIN
65,87,Grocery,Im not going to have the products in the store to by then./,SBR
65,88,Wine,But you have something and you can just open that and then do everything at the same time./,SBR
65,89,Wine,And this will also save you money because you can make money and then you get al the stuff./,SBR
65,90,Grocery,I guess actually that brings us to the issue of floor space. Which is your bringing stuff in from your warehouse./,P1
65,91,Grocery,I have stuff as well./,Sf
65,92,Grocery,How much floor space do you need?/,QP
65,93,Wine,"I have,I mean frankly I have already calculated everything and I only need 40 percent/",IP

65,95,Grocery,Well great I need 60 percent so there you go./,IP
65,96,Wine,Perfect!/,RP
65,97,Wine,So then can we decide what temperature do we want at the grocery? /,P1
65,98,Grocery,Well that actually I know is a problem because in breads they do well at a higher temperature./,IDN
65,99,Wine,Ok well how much?/,QP
65,100,Grocery,"Well you know 71 72 degrees,/",IP
65,101,Grocery,but I know wines need to be stored chilled so./,INN

65,105,Grocery,No actually apparently they do a lot better in warmer temperatures. Weve seen in the shop that they go bad more slowly if theyre at higher temperature./,SBR

65,114,Grocery,I mean I am not going to have the employees./,SBR

65,119,Grocery,Yes I understand./,MIC
65,120,Grocery,"Well I dont know if this is ok according to the rules.

65,138,Grocery,If you understand what I mean?/,MIN
65,139,Wine,Yeah I understand./,MIC
65,140,Grocery,And since I mean the renovation we can spend the money I am willing to spend it/,SBR

66,54,Grocery,,I think having employees that are well trained and well balanced would be a better part of the company to spend my money on/,SB-R

66,70,Wine,Yes/,IP

66,73,Grocery,because my food is very able to spoil. I mean it keeps better in warmer temperatures./,SB-R
66,74,Grocery,So maybe we could say like 71 degrees./,IP
66,75,Wine,71 degrees?!/,RN
66,76,Wine,Its too high/,IP
66,77,Grocery,Yeah I mean 73 degrees it what I really like but 71 degrees is ok./,IP

68,91,Grocery,So I dont know.,MI-N
68,92,Grocery,I think floor space is something we are within reach because we are not far away from each other. The thing is renovation cost.,IS
68,93,Grocery,I wonder because I dont think wine store costs so much. Wine store you dont have to spend too much money.,SB-R
68,94,Wine,Yeah but a lot about wine.,SB-R
68,95,Wine,I mean all about wine is the image of the wine and the image of the store and if it looks shabby then the wine is going to look shabby and no one likes that.,SB-R
68,96,Grocery,Well actually sometimes when you look into the antique store you feel like they have history. You dont feel bad with that.,SB-R
68,97,Wine,As long as its not dirty. Dirty and antique are different.,SB-R
68,98,Grocery,Right so I dont think we have to spend too much.,Sb-R
68,99,Wine,"I am more concerned with it looking clean,invitable, and like if its not hygienic for your food than its also not.",SB-R
68,100,Grocery,Well the thing is I think right your right.,MI-C
68,101,Grocery,Thats how much you are going to spend monthly thats cleaning cost thats not renovation cost.,SB-R
68,102,Grocery,So I am thinking like maybe we can reach the like lower renovation cost. And maybe we are going to clean it more often.,SB-R
68,103,Grocery,So renovation cost its something we can really cut down.,SB-R
68,104,Grocery,So,MI-N
68,105,Wine,Yeah,MI-N
68,106,Grocery,"How about 60 percent how about 20,000 renovation cost?",OM
68,107,Wine,Thats fine.,RP
68,108,Grocery,And Ill take 60 percent floor space ok?,QM
68,109,Wine,Ok.,MIN
68,110,Grocery,We are so quick.,MI-C
68,111,Grocery,So we agreed on 5 items.,PO
68,112,Grocery,"Hours of operation 7:30-7:30,renovation cost 20,000, floor space 60 percent for me 40 percent for you, temperature 65 degrees, grand opening date on August 1st.",MI-N
68,113,Wine,Yeah,MI-N
68,114,Grocery,Ok,MI-N
68,115,Wine,Ok.,MI-N
68,116,Grocery,"We are so quick,were done in 10 minutes.",PT
69,0,Group 69
69,1,Name of Coder: Pooja
69,2,Date:5/20/06
69,3,Grocery,"So,I guess we have to divide up the space.",MIC
69,4,Wine,Yes.,MIC
69,5,Grocery,"For me since I am a bakery,/ I would prefer to be open a little earlier. I know that might be difficult since you are a wine store.",SF/IP/INP
69,6,Grocery,So perhaps we can come to some kind of middle ground.,PC
69,7,Grocery,Is there something that you would really prefer?,QP
69,8,Wine,"Because my store is a liquor store,for me it is better to open late and close late. But I understand that you are a bakery so you cannot open very very late.",SF/IP/INP
69,9,Wine," So,is 9:30 too late for you?",OS
69,10,Grocery,9:30 would be too late.,IP
69,11,Grocery,"Since it is in D.C.,most of the work crowd would probably be at work. I was hoping hit them on their way to work. /So I was thinking more along the lines of 7:30.",SBR/ OS
69,12,Wine,"7:30 but if the store closes at 7:30people go to Dupont circle after work and maybe they have dinner there and then,I guess a lot of people come to the liquor store and it is wine and stuff.",SBR
69,13,Wine,So I prefer to close the store at 8:30.,IP
69,14,Wine,Because 6:30 is too early.,SBR
69,15,Grocery,Right and 10:30 is too late for me.,IP
69,16,Wine,"Yeah,okay.",MIN
69,17,Wine,How about 8:30?,OS
69,18,Grocery,That would be a possibility.,MIC
69,19,Grocery,We can come back to that if that is okay.,PM
69,20,Grocery,"Okay,what is something else that is very important to you?",QR
69,21,Wine,Umm renovation costs.,IR
69,22,Grocery,OK,MIN
69,23,Wine,Because umm my wine store is liquor store is targeting to high class people and our wine are very special expensive wines so both interior and exterior of the store is so important for us,SBR
69,24,Wine,"so I like to spend as much as money we can for renovation. So 3,30,000 dollars is my first choice.",IP
69,25,Grocery,"Of course,I am on the opposite end of the spectrum and dont think I can spend that much on renovation cost.",RN
69,26,Grocery,But I do understand your point wanting to do better advertising and draw more customers in. That would also benefit me.,INN
69,27,Grocery,"So perhaps we can make a deal so that you can have maybe not 30,000 in renovation cost but higher renovation cost and I could have more floor space or more say on a grand opening date.",PP
69,28,Wine,Umm when?,QP
69,29,Grocery,If I could have more floor space or a different grand opening date. Have a little bit more say in that area. I would definitely enable you to have more say in renovation cost and temperature per say.,PP
69,30,Wine,Ok actually temperature and renovation cost are important to us.,IR
69,31,Wine,So how much floor space would you like to have?,QP
69,32,Grocery,Ideally I would like 60 percent.,IP
69,33,Wine,Oh that is great because we would like 40 percent.,RP
69,34,Grocery,"Oh that would work out perfectly,then.",MIC
69,35,Wine,And I how about the grand opening date,QP
69,36,Grocery,I would prefer later.,IP
69,37,Grocery,That would also allow the renovation to take a little longer and us to make it look better / so I was leaning towards August or September.,SBR/ IP
69,38,Grocery,Wine,Oh really?,QM
69,39,Grocery,Yeah,MIN
69,40,Wine,Actually we already have all the liquor and wines we are going to sell in the store.,SBR
69,41,Wine,"Actually the earlier the better for us,",IP
69,42,Wine,but how about temperature?,QP
69,43,Grocery,"For the grocery store mostly since it is a bakery,temperature doesnt matter to us that much.",SBR
69,44,Grocery,We would prefer a higher temperature to keep energy costs down. But obviously since you are a wine store.,IP
69,45,Wine,Yeah its cooler like more temperature is better for us.,IP
69,46,Grocery,Perhaps if we open a little later temperature wouldnt have to be as cool to begin with saving a/c cost.,SBR
69,47,Grocery,But I would be willing to open in July.,OS
69,48,Grocery,I dont think I could open before July.,IB
69,49,Wine,Ok July 1st is,MIN
69,50,Grocery,Ok,MIN
69,51,Wine,Ok yes.,RP
69,52,Wine,So for us the cooler is the better,IP
69,53,Grocery,Of course,MIN
69,54,Wine,Yeah so our first choice is 65 but how do you think about it?,OS
69,55,Grocery,"I think 65 might be a little too low,but I would be willing to go to",IP/PC
69,56,Wine,How about 67?,OS
69,57,Grocery,I would at least go to 69.,OS
69,58,Wine,I may go to 67 depending on how much we spend on renovation cost.,PP
69,59,Grocery,Ok,MIN
69,60,Wine,"I would be willing to spend 20,000 in renovation cost and give you 67 degree temperature.",OM
69,61,Wine,"Otherwise I would prefer to do 65 degree and then bump the renovation cost to 25,000.",OM
69,62,Grocery,Actually that is better for us.,MIC
69,63,Grocery," So 25,000 renovation cost and 69 degrees.",RP
69,64,Wine,Yes.,MIN
69,65,Grocery,So I guess we have decided on everything right?,PO
69,66,Wine,Yes,MIN
69,67,Grocery,So we said 8:30,MIN
69,68,Wine,8:30,MIN
69,69,Grocery,"And 25,000",MIN
69,70,Wine,25 and,MIN
69,71,Grocery,60 percent of the space,MIN
69,72,Wine,40 percent for me and,MIN
69,73,Grocery,69 degrees and open July 1st.,MIN
69,74,Wine,Ok,MIN
70,0,Grocery,Hi,MI-C
70,1,Wine,Hey.,MI-C
70,2,Wine,Uhh so we have to agree on hours of operation.,P1
70,3,Wine,And what do you want?,QP
70,4,Grocery,Umm for my grocery shop we sell the breakfast.,SF
70,5,Grocery,"So as early as possible for me,like, the earlier the better.",IP
70,6,Wine,"Right,well since I am liquor store we open later",IP
70,7,Wine,because people usually buy like liquor later in the day and they really dont go out early to get it.,SB-R
70,8,Wine," So,like my ideal hours would be 10:30 to 10:30.",IP
70,9,Grocery,Yeah my ideal hours would be 6:30 to like morning to 6:30..,IP
70,10,Wine,Um hum.,MI-N
70,11,Grocery,So Im thinking probably we can umm compromise to open either 8:30,PC
70,12,Grocery,or I was thinking 7:30 would be good for me,IP
70,13,Grocery,because for your liquor store people can get the like wine after you get out of work. And 7:30 will be kind of reasonable for them toWell most of the people get off of work around 5:30 or sixish so 7:30 will be reasonable for them to get the wine after they get off work,SB-R
70,14,Grocery,,and it will be also workable for me like 7:30 is the time you go to work . So it will be easy for me to sell breakfast and so,SB-R
70,15,Grocery,Wine,Umm we can go with 8:30,RP
70,16,Grocery,because it will sort of be in the middle for both of us.,PC
70,17,Grocery,Because like most people go to work at like nine. So they go to breakfast at like 8:30 or stop by and then it wouldnt be open like it wouldnt close too early for people that want to buy liquor.,MI-C
70,18,Grocery,Grocery,Umm ok I guess that makes sense we can take probably 8:30 until 8:30 at night.,MI-C
70,19,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
70,20,Wine,Alright so renovation costs.,P1
70,21,Wine,"I want to spend a lot of money like 30,000 dollars/ because thats like you know really important for the people to think it looks nice.",IP/SB-R
70,22,Wine,Like you wouldnt want to shop somewhere where you didnt think it looked nice.,SB-R
70,23,Wine,So what do you think?,QP
70,24,Grocery,"I am more preferring 10,000 dollars",IP
70,25,Grocery,since my grocery shopping rather spend most of the money on the stuff and,SB-R
70,26,Wine,Oh no just go ahead.,MI- N
70,27,Grocery,I would rather spend most of the money on like training the employees like the newcomer and stuff.,SB-R
70,28,Grocery,Well I do agree with your point that the shop has to look nice and stuff,MIC
70,29,Grocery,but I am also worried about the quality of our employees and like the people that work there like the service and stuff.,SB-R
70,30,Grocery,So I would rather spend more money on that one instead of spending how much money on like trying to make it look good and actually not have really bad service.,IP
70,31,Wine,Yeah well we need to look ready for business.,SB-R
70,32,Wine,Well lets look at the rest of them too to see./ Whats the most important thing to you?,PM/QR
70,33,Wine,What do you want the temperature to be?,QP
70,34,Wine,And the floor space?,QP
70,35,Wine,Whats the best for you for those?,MIN
70,36,Grocery,Floor space?,QM
70,37,Wine,Um hum.,MI-N
70,38,Grocery,I was thinking like 60 percent of it.,IP
70,39,Wine,You want 60 percent?,QM
70,40,Wine,Umm ok I want like 40 percent so we could just do that.,RP
70,41,Grocery,Yeah ok so Ill take 60 percent of the space.,MIN
70,42,Wine,Ill take 40.,MIN
70,43,Wine,What do you think for temperature?,QP
70,44,Wine,I need it to be sort of cold for my liquor.,IP
70,45,Grocery,I need it to be as hot as possible.,IP
70,46,Wine,Thats pretty important to me,IR
70,47,Wine,so if I went with 67 degrees maybe we could spend less on the renovation costs cause that is better for you.,PP
70,48,Grocery,When is the best grand opening date for you?,QP
70,49,Wine,The best for me would be May 1st,IP
70,50,Wine,because I would like to start you know selling things as soon as possible.,SB-R
70,51,Wine,And that gives us enough time to get everything done that we need to.,SB-R
70,52,Grocery,I think May 1st might be a little bit too fast,IP
70,53,Grocery,because I have to order a lot of the food and like a lot of grocery stuff.,SB-R
70,54,Grocery,So I was thinking the later the better for me so like September 1st.,IP
70,55,Grocery,Wine,Ok soLets see I agreed upon,MI-N
70,56,Grocery,So Im thinking if we can open late I can agree with you on the temperature.,PP
70,57,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
70,58,Grocery,So,MI-N
70,59,Wine,So if we like if we open on July 1st or,MIN
70,60,Grocery,Im thinking about August or September,IP
70,61,Grocery,Wine,Alright if we open August 1st then can we keep it at 67 degrees?,OM
70,62,Grocery,Umm how about the renovation?,QP
70,63,Wine,"Umm we could meet in the middle. We could meet at 20,000",PC
70,64,Wine,,
70,65,Wine,because umm I think that will be fair.,SB-R
70,66,Grocery,Okay we can do that.,RP
70,67,Grocery,"So we can do 20,000 for the renovation and",MI-N
70,68,Wine,It will still look nice but it wont we wont spend too much money so then you can use it for your groceries.,MI-C
70,69,Grocery,Also 67 for temperature.,MI-N
70,70,Wine,Yeah.,MI-N
70,71,Grocery,And August 1st for the grand opening date.,MI-N
70,72,Wine,Yeah that sounds good.,MI-C
70,73,Wine,"Umm lets see alright so,I guess this looks good to me.",MI-C
70,74,Grocery,Yeah.,MI-N
71,0,Wine,Nice to meet you.,MI-C
71,1,Grocery,Nice to meet you.,MI-C
71,2,Wine,I guess we need to come to an agreement on several issues with the market.,PO
71,3,Grocery,And you are owner of the wine shop.,MI-C
71,4,Wine,"Yeah,I am the owner of the wine shop and you must be the Upper Crust grocery store.",MI-C
71,5,Grocery,So we have like 5 issues to get agreements and,PO
71,6,Grocery,"first,I would like to talk about the grand opening date,",P1
71,7,Grocery,"because even though I have my own shop here,but I have to prepare a lot for the grand openening /so I would like to have it on September if possible.",SBR/IP
71,8,Wine,"September,thats going to be quite late for me. I would rather get started earlier if we can.",IP
71,9,Wine,,
71,10,Grocery," The reason I want to have the grand opening so lately is,I have to train my keeper",SB-R
71,11,Grocery,and I have to get another stuff from abroad,SB-R
71,12,Grocery,"and I also have to prepare a lot you know,because, that is the sort of my optimal time.",SB-R
71,13,Wine,Okay.,MI-N
71,14,Wine,"Is that,is that of the issues, your most important issue, the date that we open?",QR
71,15,Grocery,"Oh right,I think so.",IR
71,16,Wine,"Okay,alrighty, so..",MI-N
71,17,Grocery,"So what is your mostly,sort of most significant things?",QR
71,18,Wine,"Okay,my biggest issue is how much we spend on renovation.",IR
71,19,Grocery,"Alright then,what about this idea that I am going to, I am going to take your side on the decoration part, that I just want you to take my part on the grand-opening date.",PP
71,20,Wine,"So we would spend 30,000 on the renovation and open september 1st?",OM
71,21,Grocery,"Ahh,hold on please, hold on please.",MI-N
71,22,Grocery,"Alright,deal.",RP
71,23,Wine,"Ok,so the renovation will be 30,000 and we will open September 1st?",QM
71,24,Wine,My next most important issue is when we are open.,IR
71,25,Grocery,"I am sorry,when we are open?",QM
71,26,Wine,Our hours of operation.,IR
71,27,Grocery,"Oh,Im sorry, okay, oh okay.",MI-N
71,28,Grocery,That is very tough things.,MI-NEG
71,29,Grocery,I just thought about near business hour is a wide thing and you have to have like acustomer finish their job and go to your shop.,SB-R
71,30,Grocery," They will be like 6pm or 7pm right,in the night.?",SB-R
71,31,Wine,Yeah I would like to be open later.,IP
71,32,Grocery,"But think of the my business,I think it is should be earlier.",IP
71,33,Wine,You want customers to come in earlier?,QS
71,34,Grocery,"Right,our target is somewhat different.",SB-R
71,35,Grocery,My target is housewives. Your target is sort of housewives and men.,SB-R
71,36,Grocery,," So I just want to warn you,basically, my ideal time is earlier the better, 6am to 6:30pm, but it also shouldnt you have like 9pm-9:30pm right?",ID-N
71,37,Grocery,,,
71,38,Wine,"Yeah,my optimal is actually going to be 10:30am to 10:30pm.",IP
71,39,Wine,"If you are targetting the housewives,6:30am seems pretty early to me to have them coming in. Do you expect to have many of them coming in at 6:30am?",SB-R
71,40,Wine,Grocery,"Basically there is another reason for my hour of operation cause Im going to have abreakfast items,thats why.",SB-R
71,41,Wine,"Your fresh items,is that what you mean?",QS
71,42,Grocery,"Right,then what about this idea, basically the portion of the fresh items in the morning is not so big to me, so what about this idea?",MI-N
71,43,Grocery,"I am going to make it later then,if we got agreement on the sort of things like, I am concerned about the temperature?",PP
71,44,Grocery," Very very important thing to me because it is all about,so sensitive, vegetable is so sensitive, you know.",IR
71,45,Grocery,"I would like to get agreement to be 71 degrees,then I am going to take like 8:30am and pm. Is it okay?",OM
71,46,Wine,So you want to have it at 71 degrees.,IN-N
71,47,Wine,Wouldnt cooler temperatures be better for your vegetables?,SB-R
71,48,Grocery,"Well,basically it is sort of different than ordinary peoples ideas about vegetables. My vegetables are sort of different here.",SB-R
71,49,Grocery,,Haha.,MI-N
71,50,Grocery,"But aah,thinking about our usual temperature, my business does require the temperature to be like 71 degree.",IP
71,51,Grocery,"So if you can agreement with that degree,I am going to agree with the hour of operation to 8:30 to 8:30 pm. Is that ok?",OM
71,52,Wine,"I actually need the temperature the cooler the better,for my wines. And so, I would rather be open, I would rather have it a little cooler, if we are actually going to be open that early.",IP
71,53,Wine,,
71,54,Wine,So I am looking at maybe having it around 69 degrees and opening ,OM
71,55,Grocery,69 degrees?,QM
71,56,Grocery,"Opening at 6:30,I mean 7:30 ?",OM
71,57,Wine,7:30 that is going to be quite early for me.,IP
71,58,Wine,What if we go with we open form 8:30 to 8:30 and go with 69 degrees?,OM
71,59,Grocery,"That was my previous suggestion to you,I am going to have 71 degree and your are going to have 8:30pm. That was my previous suggestion to you.",OM
71,60,Grocery,"Because I think the most of theIm sorry to say that I researched before this meeting that your targetting customers mostly by the winery or alcohol things from 5pm to 7pm. So regarding that time range,I think your hours of operation should be close..it should be okay, 7:30 I think, because most of the customers order their things before 7 so I think 7 is quite good.",SB-R
71,61,Grocery,"But if you want to cover another customers,your other loyal customers who visit somewhat lately then it would be ok 8:30.",SB-R
71,62,Grocery,"But if you are going to take 8:30pm,then please take 71 degrees.",OM

71,83,Wine,Cause the one I was saying is right in the middle for both of us.,PC

71,93,Grocery,You can ask that?,OT

72,12,Grocery,"Well the issue here with the hours of operation is that my,you know, my shop has breakfast and we sell coffee and baked bread and so you know we wanted to catch the crowd thats coming into work before 7./",SB-R
72,13,Grocery,So we actually perfer the opposite/,ID-N
72,14,Grocery,"and I was thinking that might even be,you know, well I guess either time seems that it would benefit you because I have a feeling that most people would purchase items on their way back from work.

72,15,Wine,Oh 5 oclock? In the morning./,MI-N

72,26,Grocery,"Alright,well, you know, I can understand that point of view but being that the renovations,/",MI-C
72,27,Grocery,I think that we would be fine with just a little bit/ and I would rather spend that extra money on something like training employees. /,IP/ SB-R
72,28,Wine,Ah yeah./,MI-N
72,29,Grocery,So thats like important to me too./,IR
72,30,Grocery,But lets just lets just keep going through these I think its easier to figure out whats best./,PO

72,40,Wine,"Um,yeah./",MI-N
72,41,Grocery,I dont know./,MI-N
72,42,Grocery,"Yeah,so I mean, if your interested in 40%, 60% would work best for me. So that seems like an agreeable place right there./",RP
72,43,Wine,So is it settled?/,QM
72,44,Wine,Is it floor space 40% for me/,MI-N
72,45,Grocery,40% for you and 60% for me./,MI-N
72,46,Grocery,Alright./,MI-N
72,47,Grocery,And for the temperature./,P1
72,48,Grocery,You know we got the one space so./,MI-N
72,49,Grocery,A higher temperature would be more beneficial to us/,IP
72,50,Grocery,because you think preserved well and it helps us keep down on air conditioning costs./,SB-R
72,51,Wine,We have many wines you know/,SB-R
72,52,Wine,"so yeah I prefer...  Id like,like below 70./",IP
72,53,Grocery,Below 70 %?/,QM

72,58,Grocery,And how bout the opening date?/,QP
72,59,Wine,The opening date./,MI-N
72,60,Wine,"The,the earlier opening would enable, enable us to make us money money much money./",SB-R
72,61,Wine,So Id prefer earlier opening./,IP
72,62,Grocery,Alright well um./,MI-N
72,63,Grocery,Yeah here I would like to have more time for training/,SB-E
72,64,Grocery,so actually the later the better for me/,IP
72,65,Grocery,Yeah also I got to order some special items that are going to take a while to get here so it would be pointless for me to open too early then I wouldnt have anything to sell./,SB-R
72,66,Wine,Yeah yeah./,MI-N
72,67,Grocery,Alright well lets just look over these options./,PO
72,68,Grocery,"Whats,how do you, whats your different preference the different categories.  Like what cate can you rank those for me?  Like, which of those is most important for you?/  ",QR
72,69,Wine,Um yeah./,MI-N
72,70,Wine,The renovation cost are the most important for for me/,IR
72,71,Grocery,Okay and how bout can you just go straight through? /,PO
72,72,Wine,Oh yeah./,MI-N
72,73,Wine,The second one is hours of operation and the next is temperature and the last grand opening date./ ,IR
72,74,Grocery,So yeah but look the floor oh floor space we already did that./,PO
72,75,Grocery,Ok well if you would agree with me having the opening date at the latest point then I would be willing to give you the you know full amount for the renovation cost/,OM
72,76,Wine,Oh it sounds it sounds good./ ,MI-C
72,77,Grocery,Do you agree with that?/,QM
72,78,Grocery,Alright cause then I wouldnt mind throwin the extra money for the last one if we opened early/,MIC
72,79,Grocery,and that would also give you the improvements you need./,MI-C
72,80,Wine,Ok so renovation cost is thirty thousand and grand opening september 1st./,MIN
72,81,Wine,"Oh yeah,alright./ ",RP
72,82,Grocery,And lets seewell as for the temperature I would like to set it set it high/,IP
72,83,Grocery,and maybe I think that because I have 60% of the floor space that means that I would be paying a larger percentage of the rent so I would be paying a larger percentage for the heating and air conditioning/,SB-R
72,84,Grocery,so would you be open to possibly doing the temperature at 71 degrees?/,OS
72,85,Wine,71?/,QM
72,86,Wine,"How bout 69?... Id prefer it like,below 70./",OS/IP
72,87,Grocery,Well how do you feel about the hours of operation./,QP
72,88,Grocery,Maybe would could make an arrangement there./,PP
72,89,Wine,Oh yeah/,MI-N
72,90,Grocery,If you/,MI-N
72,91,Grocery,"It,it seems like the midway point for us would be 8:30 to 8:30/",PC
72,92,Grocery,so maybe if I was willing to go down to 69 degrees youd would be willing to let me open the shop at 7:30 hours of operation./,OM
72,93,Wine, 7:30?/,QM
72,94,Wine,Sorry could you  could you explain/,QM
72,95,Grocery,"What Im saying was ifright now Im sayin right now you want the hours of operation to be 8:30 to 8:30,I would like it to be 7:30 to 7:30./",ID-N
72,96,Grocery,Right now its the same for the temperature where you would like it to be 69 degrees and I would like it to be 71./,ID-N
72,97,Grocery,So/,MI-N
72,98,Wine,No no./,Mineg
72,99,Wine,"I want,I want hours of operation the later opening is, the later opening is is the better or if you agree with that Id like to open at 10:30./ ",IP
72,100,Grocery,Yeah./,MI-N
72,101,Grocery,"Theres no way I would do it before,or after 9, for sure./",RN
72,102,Grocery,"So I definitely cant do those cause thats when most people start work,right?/  And the,/",SB-R/MI-N
72,103,Grocery,"what Im saying is then on the options left,I would be more willing to give up some temperature rather than give up the hours of operation/",IR
72,104,Grocery,because I wont mind paying a little more for the heating cost or the air conditioning cost if were able to make more money by having better hours./,SB-R
72,105,Wine,Yeah./,MI-N
72,106,Grocery,It seems like thered be no way youd be willing to do the temperature above 70 degrees right?/,QP
72,107,Wine,Yeah./,IP
72,108,Grocery,So we have to reach an agreement on these remaining three options in each category./,PO
72,109,Wine,Yeah thats right./ ,MI-N
72,110,Grocery,And what I was saying is that since I do have more floor space I would prefer to have a higher temperature/,IP
72,111,Grocery,"to,to keep the costs down since I would be paying more/",SB-R
72,112,Grocery,but I would also be willing to be more lenient on the temperature since I would able to make more money off of having better hours./,PC
72,113,Wine,Yeah./,MI-N
72,114,Grocery,So so I would propose 7:30 to 7:30 on the hours of operation if I could be more lenient on the temperature./,PP
72,115,Grocery,"Does it matter wether its lower than,like, is 67 better for you than 69 or does it make a difference?/",QP
72,116,Wine,Yeah./ It makes little difference/,IP
72,117,Wine,,but Id like that the hours of operation be have more priority./,IR
72,118,Grocery,So you have the same issue?/,QM
72,119,Wine,"Yeah like yeah Id prefer if I if we have like 71 degrees,I want to open the shop at 9:30 a.m/ ",OM
72,120,Grocery,Well theres no way that Id be able/,RN
72,121,Wine,"But if if you if you accept 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. then you can open the,open your shop longer in night, night, at night./",SB-R
72,122,Grocery,Yeah I think I see where your coming from/,MI-C
72,123,Grocery,but the fact is that not that many people are gonna want coffee at night; the interest is going to be in the morning./,SB-R
72,124,Grocery,We have the opposite agreement. Youd like it to be lower and Id like it to be higher./ ,ID-N
72,125,Wine,So how bout 8:30 to 8:30?/,OS
72,126,Grocery,And what were you thinking for temperature?/,QP
72,127,Wine,71 71 degrees./,IP
72,128,Grocery,Youd leave it at 71 if I could have the hours of operation at 8:30?/,OM

If theres poor customer service then the customers would not come back because theyre not happy with their experience shopping at our store./,SB-R,IR
74,12,Grocery,," So I was thinking maybe the renovation cost shouldnt be as much as,shouldnt make it like really luxurious and stuff because customer service is more important./",IP,
74,13,Wine,I think the way the store looks is really really important too./,SB-R,,"Like,you dont want to go it somewhere that looks pretty bad. Customer service is pretty good./",SB-R,
74,14,Wine,"But the kind of job of just like ringing people up doesnt cost that much money in training.  Like,its really not that hard to ring people up and smile./",SB-R,
74,15,Wine,Like its more about choosing the right people than training them in the right things./ ,SB-R,SB-R
74,16,Grocery,How much do you think that well need?/,QP,Wine,"I was thinking 30,000 dollars./",IP,Grocery,"30,000?/",RN,,Thats a little too much for me/,IP,,because a lot of a lot of times in the grocery store you need good customer service cause they cant sometimes they cant find where you know the bread is or whatever they want is.  So they would need to ask an employee and like if they seem like theyre not that happy to help you they wouldnt be that happy at the store so they wouldnt come back/,SB-R,,"and a lot of people they come to my side of the store and they come to yours.  So,if my side the employee they are not nice to the customers they might not even come back so we would both lose a lot of business./",SB-R,
74,17,Grocery,"So I was thinking maybe 15,000 dollars?/",OS,OS
74,18,Wine,We really want that to look a little bit nicer just to get people to start going in./,SB-R,,"20,000?/",OS,OS
74,19,Grocery,"20,000 is fine./",RP,,Ok./,MI-N,RP
74,20,Grocery,So the floor space./,P1,Wine,Ok I cannot afford rent if I have more than 40%./,SB-R,,So I was hoping not to have more than 40%/,IP,IP
74,21,Grocery,cause I cant afford it then./ ,SB-R,(even if two SBRs)
74,22,Grocery,Well I need a lot of floor space./,IP,,I mean that kind of works out for the both of us cause you you dont want to use a lot of floor space cause you cant afford it./,IS,,So I was thinking/,MI-N,IP
74,23,Wine,But 40% also like holds all of my like/,IP,like less than that than I dont have enough space for all of my products./,SB-R,IP
74,24,Wine,I dont know how it shows for your products./,MI-N,Grocery,Well I was thinking 60% for me and then 40% for you./,OS,Wine,Ok/,RP,Grocery,Is that Ok?/,QM,Wine,That works./,MI-C,Grocery,Ok and for the temperature/,P1,,I was thinking to put the temperature at a warmer side of the barameter/,IP,,cause I want the customers to come in and feel warm and comfortable where as if its too cold or too hot that wouldnt make them comfortable or something./,SB-R,IP
74,25,Wine,Well I was thinking that my wines and my liquors are best preserved at like 65 degrees/,IP,,"and like your products you like,if they need a certain temperature theyre like either heated or theyre like in the fridge and my products you cant do that.  They just need to be sitting there and I dont want them to like ruin and just like/",SB-R,IP
74,26,Grocery,The thing is that I think that 65 degrees is a little bit too cold/,IP,,"so the customers when they come in like they,cause most people I think they spend more time at the grocery side theyre buying all their grocery and then come in and buy their wine but it wont take as long as being in the grocery store./",SB-R,IP
74,27,Wine,Usually people come into the grocery store and get groceries and go theyre not like staying to like enjoy the atmosphere and stuff so./,SB-R,Grocery,I think well I need 73 degrees to get to have my foods well preserved./,SB-R,,So I was thinking we could compromise/,PC,PC
74,28,Wine,What foods needs to be preserved at 73 degrees?/,QS,Grocery,"Oh,it says that like the majority.  Like some kind of like bread preserve and meat and stuff like that.  They need to be um they need to stay preserved at a higher temperature that I guess/",SB-R,
74,29,Wine,I wouldnt think that meats would need to be at a higher temperature./ ,SB-R,Grocery,And then we also have a refrigerated stuff/,SB-R,Wine,That stuffs refrigerated./,SB-R,,The overall temperature I dont think it affects the grocery store food as much as it affects wine and liquor./,SB-R,,Bread is bread its usally there for like a day or two and then its going to be stail no matter what./,SB-R,,You dont want to sell unfresh bread anyway./,SB-R,SB-R
74,30,Grocery,How bout we compromise at 69 degrees./,OS,OS
74,31,Grocery,So its like a little better./,MI-C,Wine,Well is there a big difference in two degrees if we did 67?/,OS,Grocery,Huh?/,MI-N,Wine,If we did 67 degrees its only 2 degrees lower./,SB-R,Grocery,Yeah but then its like a lot different from what I want for my store./,RN,,So I was thinking like maybe in the middle we could meet in the middle/,PC,PC
74,32,Wine,69 Alright well just do 69./,RP,Grocery,"And for the grand opening date,/",P1,,"I was thinking maybe,I was thinking um.. the grand opening date should be as late as possible/",IP,
74,33,Wine,"because is then it would be nearly like in the winter and people usually eat at home more,more eat at home in the winter than in the summer because in the summer the weathers out and the weathers nice and they would go out to eat/",SB-R,
74,34,Wine,so I was thinking maybe around september would be the best time to open/,IP,,because a lot of people would buy the groceries home for like Christmas for Thanksgiving and that they would buy more liquor because theyre so much holiday that they can celebrate for./,SB-R,IP
74,35,Wine,"But again,like, if summer time people are going to want to get barbque stuff they going to get all kinds/",SB-R,
74,36,Wine,like summers the time like I actually work in the summer and theyre slowest at restaurants and they eat at home most and like I think the grocery store would do really well.  I think wed make a lot of money over the summer I think the both of us/,SB-R,,like like a grand opening in like May/,IP,,"like just a lot of stuff opens in may and a lot of stuff is ending like school and people are looking for more things to do,and, not do but like shop/",SB-R,SB-R
74,37,Wine,"and I think September would be like a long time to wait because its just,like, if it was a restaurant I would say september but./ ",SB-R,(more SB-R even if IP present)
74,38,Wine,Grocery,I think where we live during the summer like maybe August is still really warm and most people still have like barbques and then its also pretty close to September where all Thanksgiving and Christmas is at./,SB-R,Wine,May has a couple holi like what holiday is may.  Is it like Memorial day or something./,SB-R,,,And like everyone is getting stuff like that everyone drinks a lot everyone eats a lot especially graduation parties I think graduation parties and end of the year parties/,SB-R,,I think may is a really good month for this./,IP,IP
74,39,Wine,Like food is especially just as much as liquor/,SB-R,(even if two SBRs)
74,40,Grocery,I think it would be open at May. That would be a really great loss to me/,RN,,because I actually want more time to like train my employees/,SB-R,,also because im very high on customer service so/,SB-R,,and I need to order like special items from like italy and all that/,SB-R,SB-R
74,41,Wine,But if you started in May we could start selling your other stuff and that would start getting out there./,SB-R,,"people would start getting to know the restaurant and when those products came in theyd be really really,theyd sell really fast cause people would already know about us./",SB-R,SB-R
74,42,Grocery,"I think if I,if I dont have the special items while the store has opened then it would not attract as many customer/",SB-R,
74,43,Grocery,cause I want the grand opening to be grand not just have a little bit and not having ordered the specialty stuff that most people are looking forward in getting because our store is like a top tier store./,SB-R,SB-R
74,44,Wine,I think if we compromised to maybe June 1st /,PC,,"cause that that way theres still a lot of graduation stuff going on theres a lot of different kind of things I think wed both,I think that be enough time for training and for some of your products at least to start and it doesnt take that long to ship things.",MI-C,PC
74,45,Wine,Grocery,How bout July/,OS,,"cause I,I still really need a lot of time ordering the items./",SB-E,
74,46,Wine,Even if we open in June the items will not come in till like maybe August but I can sacrifice that month of not having the specialty items because still new customers would be coming during that month so they would see the new specialty items and they would keep on coming./,SB-R,OS
74,47,Wine,Julys cool/,RP,Grocery,Ok.  Ok./,MI-N,PO
74,48,Wine,Are we done?/,PO,Wine,Yup.  /,MI-N,Grocery,I think we just went down the middle for like all of it/,OT,Wine,I dont even want to be in business./,OT,OT
74,49,Wine,Its like you have to be mean./,OT,Grocery,Yeah its like I was like.. /,OT,Wine,Its not the kind of stuff I think about/,OT,75,0,Group 75

75,8,Grocery,Sure. Uh huh.,MIN
75,9,Wine,Ok so we can open at 6:30 and stay open till 6:30 or we can open at 10:30 and stay open till 10:30,MIN
75,10,Wine,Grocery,Yeah,MIN
75,11,Wine,"Yeah,I was hoping for later opening hour",IP
75,12,Wine,because thats better for me. You know you have people coming in during the evening and ordering wine and stuff,SBR
75,13,Grocery,Ok.  Ok. ,MIN
75,14,Grocery,Well for me earlier is the better,IP
75,15,Grocery,because its a specialty shop we sell like coffees and like donuts and those like you know morning stuff so,SBR
75,16,Wine,So people come in with the lun morning run morning rush.,MIC
75,17,Wine,Yeah,MIN
75,18,Grocery,Yeah. ,MIN
75,19,Grocery,So I dont know I guess we are in the opposite so,IDN
75,20,Wine,Well I guess another question to ask is what other stuff could we do to help each other with this,MIC
75,21,Grocery,Right,MIN
75,22,Wine,Yeah so obvioulsy theres going to be some issues here and I guess we should ask which ones would maximize our profit if we are going to be operating in Dupont and stuff.  Yeah either way we either hit the comu commuters in the morning or hit the wine junkies in the evening,MIN
75,23,Grocery,Yeah sure Maybe well breakfast,MIN
75,24,Grocery,I guess the companys place to start you know like work starts around 9?,OS
75,25,Wine,So maybe 8:30 or so.,OS
75,26,Grocery,Yeah that way youll have you know your like,RP
75,27,Wine,Yeah thats nice.,MIC
75,28,Wine,That way you get the morning crowd and I get some people picking up stuff in the evening.,MIC
75,29,Grocery,Right yeah,MIN
75,30,Wine,"Ok,renovation costs so we can run from 30,000 to 10,000. ",P1
75,31,Wine,I think that having a nice front really attracts people so it might be worth it to spend a little more there,SBR
75,32,Wine,"Yeah I was going to say the most expensive is 30,000 but it would look really good when we were done probably especially right now with all the hurricane damage and stuff. ",IP
75,33,Wine,You canconstruction costs are probably through the roof all over the place but I guess it really depends,SBR
75,34,Grocery,Well for me its um we have umwe have right yeah well we need money for like training new employees and those too,SBR
75,35,Grocery,and not sure if we really need that much work for inside especially.,SBR
75,36,Grocery,So..,MIN
75,37,Wine,Yeah but think about how good it looks sometimes like comparing certain places gourmet to Shoppers or something like Costco. So I guess it depends on who were catering to partly.  In Dupont we really are getting the people who are like oh my gosh I set foot in a warehouse eeep. ,SBR
75,38,Grocery,Yeah but.,MIN
75,39,Grocery,Yeah.,MIN
75,40,Grocery,Yeah but there are things like we need to train like you know to make the employees like you know special like and they have to have some knowledge on like both wine specialty things,SBR
75,41,Wine,Which is going to be a little more.,MIN
75,42,Grocery,Right so I dont think we should spend that much money to like renovate and I think we can like you know slowly renovate like you know little by little,SBR
75,43,Wine,That could get complicated but I see where your coming from with that.,MIC
75,44,Wine,Maybe we could do a trade off with something else.  Like jumping ahead a bit for floor space.  Yeah it might affect how we start with the distribution of that.,PP
75,45,Wine," So I dont know maybe 25,000 for renovation.",OS
75,46,Grocery,"Yeah let lets say 25,000 for now and maybe we can move on and",RP
75,47,Wine,and come back if we have time,PO
75,48,Grocery,right. ,MIN
75,49,Grocery,And floor space,P1
75,50,Wine,I was going for about 40% of the floor space. ,IP
75,51,Wine,I figure give a little give more to the grocery give a little more to the shop.,SBR
75,52,Grocery,Thats great because I would like 60%.,RP
75,53,Grocery,So,MIN
75,54,Wine,Ok thats easy.,MIC
75,55,Grocery,Hey that worked. ,MIC
75,56,Grocery,Ok so how bout the temperature.,P1

75,67,Wine,Maybe like 67 or so.  Raise it just a little bit.,OS
75,68,Grocery,How bout a little more because the what I was aiming for was 73 so,IP
75,69,Grocery,,
75,70,Wine,Thats going to be a really high energy bill though,SBR
75,71,Grocery,Yeah so how bout like 69 is that ok?,OS
75,72,Wine,"Ok,half and half I can go with that. ",RP
75,73,Grocery,How bout the opening,P1

75,83,Wine,But you know.,MIN
75,84,Wine," And if we have especially if we have that May opening a lot of people go on like holiday once its gets to be more,more summery so you get you lose foot traffic to a certain extent ",SBR
